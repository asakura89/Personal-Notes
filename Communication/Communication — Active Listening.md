Listening is one of the most important skills you can have in both your personal and professional life. But how do you become a great listener, not just a good one? In this blog post, we'll share some insights and advice from experts on how to listen actively, empathetically, and effectively.

## What is active listening?

Active listening is a way of engaging with the speaker that shows you are paying attention, interested, and supportive. It involves more than just staying silent, nodding your head, and repeating back what they said. According to authors Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman, active listeners are like trampolines, giving the speaker's thoughts height, acceleration, energy, and amplification.

To be an active listener, you need to:

- Put away all distractions, such as your phone or laptop
- Make eye contact and use appropriate body language
- Ask open-ended questions that encourage the speaker to elaborate
- Reflect back what you heard and check for understanding
- Summarize the main points and key messages
- Provide feedback and suggestions if appropriate

## How to listen empathetically

Empathetic listening is a way of listening that shows you care about the speaker's feelings and emotions. It involves more than just being sympathetic or compassionate. It means putting yourself in their shoes and trying to understand their perspective.

To be an empathetic listener, you need to:

- Avoid judging or criticizing the speaker
- Acknowledge and validate their emotions
- Express empathy and support
- Help them explore their options and solutions
- Respect their choices and decisions

## How to listen effectively

Effective listening is a way of listening that helps you achieve your goals and objectives. It involves more than just being attentive or curious. It means being strategic and purposeful in your listening.

To be an effective listener, you need to:

- Know your purpose and expectations for the conversation
- Identify the key information and insights you need
- Focus on the relevant and important details
- Take notes and organize your thoughts
