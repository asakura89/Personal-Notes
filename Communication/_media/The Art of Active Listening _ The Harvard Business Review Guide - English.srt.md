AMY GALLO: Are you
a good listener?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,100
No, really.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,880
Are you?

4
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,584
You might think you are because
you stay silent while they're

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,320
talking, nod your
head and say mm-hmm,

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
and repeat back, word for
word, what you heard them say.

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
This has been standard
management advice

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
on good listening for ages.

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,910
But what if I told you
that following these tips

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,900
could leave the listener feeling
unheard or even dismissed?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
The truth is that mastering
the art of listening

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,530
involves a whole
host of other skills.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
You need to do more.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,700
In this video, you'll
learn techniques

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
that will help you in both
professional and personal

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,860
relationships.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,090
Are you ready to be not just a
good listener but a great one?

18
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,350
Let's get started.

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,850
The first step after putting
away all distractions,

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
like cell phones and
laptops, is to recognize

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
that listening is an active,
noncompetitive, two-way

22
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,150
interaction.

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
Authors Jack Zenger
and Joseph Folkman

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
write that we shouldn't be
passive, like a sponge merely

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,590
absorbing information.

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,890
Instead, we need to
be active listeners,

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,430
like a trampoline, giving the
speaker's thoughts height,

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,150
acceleration, energy,
and amplification.

29
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,450
But how do you become a
so-called trampoline listener?

30
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:23,470
First, it's important
to ask yourself,

31
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,030
how do I usually listen?

32
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Maybe you're typically
task-oriented,

33
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,090
focused on efficiency;
or analytical,

34
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,330
aiming to analyze problems
from a neutral perspective;

35
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,870
or relational, building
connections and responding

36
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,260
emotionally; or critical,
perhaps judging both

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,590
the content and the speaker.

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,540
You may, out of habit, default
to one of these styles in most

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,470
situations.

40
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,500
But if you then
ask yourself, why

41
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,860
do I need to listen
right now, you

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,780
may realize that a different
mode or a combination of modes

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,710
is better suited
for this moment.

44
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,990
Is a family member in
need of emotional support,

45
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,020
or a coworker hoping
for an honest critique?

46
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,290
Reflecting on the goals of each
conversation, what you want,

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
and what the speaker needs
will help you determine

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
the best way to listen.

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
This question can also remind
us to listen without an agenda

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
so we can process what
the other person is saying

51
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,860
without formulating a response.

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,110
At some point in
the conversation,

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
you'll likely have to
share your perspective.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
But for now, take
in what they have

55
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
to say without thinking
about what you'll say next.

56
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Another question to ask is,
who is the focus of attention

57
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
in the conversation?

58
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Sharing your own
personal stories

59
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,390
can establish connection
and validation.

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
But you don't want to
steer the conversation away

61
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,970
from the speaker
in a way that makes

62
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
them feel dismissed or unheard.

63
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Also, you can ask,
what am I missing?

64
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,580
Remember, good
listening is much more

65
00:02:58,980 --> 00:02:59,980
than nodding, saying
mm-hmm, and parroting back

66
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
what you heard the person say.

67
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,420
In reality, speaking up and
asking good questions signals

68
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,910
to the speaker that not only
have you heard what they said,

69
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
but you understood it enough
to want more information.

70
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,610
It can also profoundly
changed the conversation.

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,270
If you pay attention to
verbal and nonverbal cues,

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
that may reveal that
the speaker has more

73
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,630
to say than what
appears at face value.

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
They may be uncertain about
sharing vulnerability,

75
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,540
or they may not even
realize that they're

76
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
expressing unexamined emotions.

77
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Asking questions based on
what may have been left unsaid

78
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,940
can show the other person that
you were listening deeply.

79
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,210
It can make them feel
supported and lead

80
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,550
to insight for both of you.

81
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,330
Here's an example.

82
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,710
An employee tells you, I'm
worried about my presentation

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,730
for the board meeting.

84
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,990
You might try to naturally
reassure and relate

85
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
by saying something like,
oh, you're going to be great.

86
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
It took me years before I could
present without being nervous.

87
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Unfortunately, while
you're attempting

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
to make a connection here,
that kind of response

89
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,540
can actually dismiss
their concerns

90
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,670
without inviting further detail.

91
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,350
It ignores what might be an
important issue underlying

92
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,950
their statement and
switches the focus to you.

93
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,459
To show that you're
listening in a deeper way,

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
you can say something
like, I was nervous

95
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,839
when I started presenting too.

96
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,550
What's worrying you?

97
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,990
Big difference, right?

98
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
When trying to be
a better listener,

99
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,950
another good question
to ask yourself

100
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
is, am I getting in my own way?

101
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,990
All too often, we
prevent ourselves

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
from being able to listen deeply
because of our own insecurities

103
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
or head trips.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
We might be emotionally
uncomfortable

105
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,920
or worry about how
confident and prepared

106
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
we seem to the other person.

107
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,450
With practice, quieting
that internal monologue

108
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,170
will leave space to
actually hear what's

109
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
being said by the other person.

110
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
So far, we've been
talking about how anyone

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
can be a better listener.

112
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,710
But if you're a senior leader,
where much more is at stake,

113
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
good listening is
an imperative skill.

114
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,670
It's wise to ask, am I
in an information bubble?

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Many leaders find themselves
in those information bubbles

116
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,370
because employees are afraid
of questioning, challenging,

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
second-guessing, or
disappointing them.

118
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
They may spin information
in a positive light

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
to avoid tough conversations
with leadership.

120
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,910
As Kevin Sharer, former CEO
and chairman of Amgen, said,

121
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,050
"If you walk around and see a
bunch of smiling faces and say,

122
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,070
'Gee, everybody looks happy
to me,' you're not listening."

123
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Leaders must develop
the discipline

124
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
to listen purely
for comprehension

125
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,470
without judgment,
agenda, or distraction

126
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
and actively seek input
from all levels and ranks.

127
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,210
Also, creating an
atmosphere that

128
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,580
prioritizes trust
over hierarchy means

129
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,030
anybody can feel comfortable
sharing information,

130
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,890
whether it's good or bad.

131
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,010
OK.

132
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
Let's review.

133
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
Most conversations
would benefit if we

134
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,720
could be active, supportive
trampoline listeners instead

135
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
of passive information sponges.

136
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
To do this, you
can ask yourself,

137
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,030
how do I usually listen?

138
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,830
Reflecting on your
default listening style

139
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,140
can help you assess how to
improve your listening skills.

140
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,650
Why do I need to
listen right now?

141
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,170
Thinking about what
the other person might

142
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,150
need from your conversation
can provide clues

143
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,820
as to how you can best
listen at that moment.

144
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Who is the focus of attention
in the conversation?

145
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,570
Be careful sharing
your own experiences

146
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,030
in an attempt to connect.

147
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,830
You don't want to steer the
conversation away from what

148
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,370
the speaker is trying to say.

149
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,590
What am I missing?

150
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,300
Ask good questions not
only about what is said

151
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,930
but what may be left unsaid.

152
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,530
Am I getting in my own way?

153
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,420
Be careful not to let your own
internal monologue prevent you

154
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,050
from truly being able
to listen deeply.

155
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:07,810
And for our current and
future senior leaders

156
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,030
out there, ask, am I in
an information bubble?

157
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,510
Practice listening
purely for comprehension.

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And create an environment where
employees have opportunities

159
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,660
to share feedback and
feel comfortable doing so.

160
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,350
Thanks for watching.

161
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,490
All of the strategies
that I've shared today

162
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
are based on HBR
articles linked below.

163
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
Do you have your own strategies
for becoming a better listener?

164
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,860
Or is there a topic you want us
to cover in a future HBR video?

165
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,820
Comment below.

166
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,870
We're listening.

167
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Bye.
