00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,300
Does it ever feel like executive communications are hard, but somehow

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,260
you are observing other people and it seems really easy for them?

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,930
What I wanna share with you today are five key principles that you can

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,100
implement to make executive communications easy.

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
And the way that I'm gonna share it with you is that I'm gonna start

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,140
by sharing five mistakes that people make and then to share a solution

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:21,580
moving forward for them.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
And as you're going through these mistakes, I want you to reflect on

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,140
your own career path, your own communications as well, so you can see

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,140
how that's been playing out.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,460
And therefore you can see the application of what I'm about to share.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
And if this resonates with you, I want you to comment below and let me

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,620
know what resonates with you the most.

14
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,350
As well remember to subscribe to my channel, ring the notification

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,860
bell as well, so you can be notified every time I release a new video

16
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,900
every single week.

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,070
So let's go.

18
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:47,910
Mistake number one.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
The mistake here is thinking that the purpose of executive

20
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,860
communication is to impress.

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,240
And here's why that is a mistake.

22
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,130
When we feel the need to impress somebody, we necessarily need to puff

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,620
ourselves up.

24
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,510
We need to necessarily put ourselves above our audience.

25
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:05,819
And in that moment, we need to be able to be impressive.

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,790
So think about it, when you are impressive to someone, you're trying

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,540
to make an impression and impress them, we need to be puffed up.

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
We need to be grand, we need to be proud, and therefore we need to

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,260
look down on someone and show them why we are better than.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
And in that communication, that mindset as well, the attitude and the

31
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,780
approach to communication come, comes across inauthentic.

32
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,910
It comes across strong, it comes across rubbing the wrong way.

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,180
However it is that can be perceived, there's a degree of

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
inauthenticity there.

35
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,710
So what's the solution?

36
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:40,110
If you've been thinking that executive communication is there for you

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,540
to be impressive, for you to make an impression, I submit to you that

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
the purpose is different, shift your mindset.

39
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,350
Because the purpose of executive communication is not to impress The

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,940
purpose of executive communication, rather is to impact speak to

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,980
impact, not to impress.

42
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,710
So here's what I mean by that.

43
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,610
When you speak to make an impact, this is where you are seeing your

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,220
audience as your equals.

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,330
They are not above you, they are not beneath you.

46
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,580
You don't need to puff yourself up.

47
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,100
You don't need to pretend to be somebody you're not.

48
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,180
You didn't need to put on personas or to act as though or to pretend

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,420
about something else.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
You just are present to make an impact because you understand to make

51
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
an impact, you are making your most important contribution.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
You are serving to your highest level.

53
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
You are making the best contribution with insights to the most

54
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
thorough way possible, right through to completion.

55
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,690
That is how you make an impact.

56
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
And simply shifting the way you see the purpose of executive

57
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,860
communication will cause you to show up differently.

58
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,590
It will cause you to show up, present and poise.

59
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,100
It will cause you to show up as a leader and it will cause you to show

60
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,180
up with the calmness that you have desired.

61
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,030
So speak to impact, not to impress.

62
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,150
That is the first milestone and it stems from the mistake that most

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
people make and that is touted in social media that we need to make a

64
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
strong first impression.

65
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:11,970
So think that through.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What does it mean when we try to impress somebody?

67
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,550
What exactly what is the essence of what we're doing when we need to

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,040
try to impress somebody?

69
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:20,690
Is that truly authentic?

70
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Right?

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
So speak to impact, not to impress.

72
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,070
That is the first one.

73
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,650
Mistake number two that I see in executive communications is not

74
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
creating a fair exchange through communications.

75
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
You see what happens is that when you're communicating at the

76
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
executive level, you have different people coming together and every

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
individual that comes together in that room or in that conversation,

78
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
every individual has a different set of values.

79
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
And every individual is driven by that set of values.

80
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
Their actions, their decisions, their behaviors, their perspectives

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
are all driven by that value.

82
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,620
But you have different values come together.

83
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
And that's why conflict is very common.

84
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,230
That's why conflict is unavoidable, because you have different values.

85
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Sometimes another person's value is so different from yours that it

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
appears to be contradicting.

87
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,730
It appears to be direct opposite of yours, opposition to yours.

88
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,530
So what happens is that you have these different values come together,

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,560
different sets of values come together, and every individual coming

90
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
together in that conversation, the one thing they want to achieve, the

91
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
one thing that they're de dedicated towards is how do I fulfill my

92
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,120
values?

93
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
How do I achieve my goals?

94
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,940
How do I fulfill what's most important to me?

95
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
How do I achieve the top priority that I have set for myself?

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Everybody coming into that conversation has that in common.

97
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,290
So what do you do?

98
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
The key of executive communication is coming through a resolution and

99
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,120
coming through to solve problems and coming through united on the

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,760
other side.

101
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,290
So how do you create that union?

102
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,690
If it is true, what I shared with you that individuals just wanna

103
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
fulfill their top priorities, just wanna fulfill their most important

104
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
values, then the key is how do you create a fair exchange?

105
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
How can you fulfill what's important for them and also what's

106
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
important to you as well?

107
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
That is a fair exchange and that is the only situation in which

108
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
relationships are meaningful is when there is a fair exchange between

109
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
parties involved.

110
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,620
The biggest mistake I see that comes out of this mistake is that

111
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
individuals come up into executive communication situations and they

112
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
just share information.

113
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,550
They just share data, they just share updates.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
And that's the extent of their, their executive communications.

115
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
The problem with that is that now you just end up sounding like

116
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
everybody else, sharing data, sharing information, sharing updates.

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
You just sound like everybody else.

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,780
And but the higher level of communication in effective executive

119
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
communications is exactly creating that fair exchange.

120
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,430
Just simply sharing data, information, knowledge, and updates, just

121
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
simply sharing those things does not create a fair exchange.

122
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,470
A fair exchange is the fulfillment of individual values, right?

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
So that is mistake number two.

124
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,050
Mistake number three is not developing communication skills.

125
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,980
You notice how this deals with the skill set.

126
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
The first two mistakes, mistake number one and two, dealt with your

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
mindset.

128
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,230
This one deals with your skillset.

129
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,950
Oftentimes, career professionals work very hard at developing their

130
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
technical skills, going to school, going to get certifications,

131
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,350
diplomas at master's degrees, MBAs going to really work hard and

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
taking courses technical knowledge to to, to build their knowledge

133
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
base around their technical area of expertise.

134
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,990
Oftentimes, career professionals spend a lot of time, energy, money

135
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
and resources in developing those those technical skills only to find

136
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
later on at the executive level that those technical skills matter

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
less and less and less.

138
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
And what matters more and more is your ability to communicate those

139
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:01,110
skills.

140
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,970
Society calls these softer skills.

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Society likes to call them soft skills, but you're gonna notice at

142
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
this level that they're not so soft after all.

143
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,450
At the level of executive and beyond when you are a senior manager to

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
wanting to break into the boardroom, wanting to break into executive

145
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,480
levels, you're gonna notice that people who communicate advance

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
farther and faster, people who are effective in their communications,

147
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
who can express and articulate very well, they advance into

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
leadership, they advance and they are given in invitations to become

149
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
an executive.

150
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,180
And that's because communication skills is where it's at.

151
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,970
So the mistake that people make is focusing so much on executive,

152
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
sorry, focusing so much on technical skills at this level and not

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
enough emphasis on developing communication skills.

154
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Now, communication skills is not just about what you say and how you

155
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
say it.

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Communication skills is not about reducing your accent or being able

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
to pronounce words clearly.

158
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
That's not only communications.

159
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,400
That's such a small sliver of communication skills.

160
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
Communication skills also involves leadership.

161
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
How do you lead effectively?

162
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
How do you communicate the vision?

163
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,820
How do you get everybody on board?

164
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
How do you get buy-in?

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How do you negotiate effectively?

166
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
How do you change direction and communicate different decisions?

167
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
How do you assure that all of your team's voices are being heard and

168
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
create greater unification?

169
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Those are all communications as well.

170
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Not to mention presenting, not to mention being able to give feedback.

171
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Those are all communications.

172
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,620
You see, it's much more than just reducing your accent or pronouncing

173
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
words or your vocal intonations.

174
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
It's much more than that.

175
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,760
It's much deeper than that.

176
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,429
It's also being able to navigate the landscape around you so that you

177
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
can grow, so that you can manage different cultures that you're

178
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
working with, different educational backgrounds, different

179
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
communication styles, and everybody who has different opinions.

180
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,800
How do you navigate that complex landscape?

181
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
That's also communication skills too.

182
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,610
So if you're listening to this and you feel yes, and now I see it and

183
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
it's important to you, then I invite you to work with me.

step up into executive leadership.

187
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
How do you develop the right mindset?

188
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
Then how do you develop the right skillset?

189
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
And finally, what is the tool set to advance?

190
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,970
If you're serious about achieving this then below in the description,

191
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280

So click the link below and I'll see you on the inside.

197
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,690
So what is mistake number four?

198
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:51,570
Mistake number four is trying to find opportunities.

199
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:55,750
A lot of career professionals that I teach and coach in my program,

200
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,930
they've been trying to look hard for opportunities.

201
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,950
They go on Google to Google their companies and look at what career

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
job postings they have.

203
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,870
They go on LinkedIn to look for job postings there indeed, to look for

204
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,600
job postings.

205
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
They go to network solaris to see what opportunities people are

206
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
opening up and they wait for opportunities every once in a while,

207
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,320
periodically, once a week or once a month, they go again and they look

208
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
again, finding opportunities.

209
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,110
That is mistake number four, stop looking for opportunities, stop

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
finding opportunities, and instead become the kind of person that they

211
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
discover that is the person who can fulfill the roles and

212
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
responsibilities they desire.

213
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,700
How do you be make yourself more discoverable?

214
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,030
Stop looking and become, and instead become more discoverable.

215
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,620
Now get this.

216
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,050
If there is something noteworthy about you, this is where you can step

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
up to really demonstrate the value you have to bring for that next

218
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
role.

219
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
And more importantly, to position yourself at that next level that you

220
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
wanna be.

221
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
The key is to start positioning yourself right now because there is a

222
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
position, there is a role in your mind that is inspiring to you, that

223
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
is fulfilling your calling and your life purpose.

224
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
What is that role?

225
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
What is it that is aligned with who you are and the values that you

226
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,960
have?

227
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
There is a position like that.

228
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,630
What is it?

229
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
What will you be doing?

230
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,380
And chances are you don't have that title yet, but you need to already

231
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
be positioning yourself there.

232
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,100
And the positioning is what helps you to become discoverable.

233
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,970
So when you become discoverable, they come and find you.

234
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:32,950
You're not looking for opportunities as somebody who is unknown to

235
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
them.

236
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
You become discoverable and they see the value that you bring and they

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
come to you because you can become the person who can fulfill the

238
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
roles and responsibilities they desire.

239
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,530
So that is the fourth point.

240
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,420
And now we come to the final mistake.

241
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,370
Mistake number five.

242
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,110
And mistake number five is communicating what you know.

243
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,460
Now I get that this sounds like it's very counterintuitive because

244
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
we've been taught and programmed to talk about what we know to

245
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
demonstrate what we know.

246
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
The problem with that is that at the executive level communicating

247
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
what you know is facts and information and data.

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
That's not what transforms.

249
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
And that's a lot of detail.

250
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,850
So instead of that, and I get it, what stems from that the drive to

251
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,920
communicate what we know the drive to it comes back to mistake number

252
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
one.

253
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Remember, mistake number one is the thought that the purpose of

254
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
executive communication is to impress.

255
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,780
And that's where it comes from because we feel the need to impress,

256
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
and that's why we tell everybody what we know we want.

257
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,960
We wanna communicate what we know.

258
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,310
It's that need to impress.

259
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
But remember the correction to mistake number one was not to, instead

260
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,680
of speaking to impress, speak to impact.

261
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,660
And so speaking towards that, the best way to speak to make an impact

262
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,450
is instead of speaking what you know, instead of communicating what

263
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
you know, articulate your principles, your principles, these are the

264
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
thought processes behind what you know.

265
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
And when you communicate on a principle's basis, when you communicate

266
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
at the principles level, this is how you increase, you significantly

267
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,680
increase the perception of the value you have to bring, right?

268
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
So those are the five mistakes and the solutions to each of those five

269
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
mistakes.

270
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,420
Now, if you are right now in executive communications and you're

271
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
finding that there's an intense fear whenever you speak to executives

272
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
and you're wondering, how do I overcome that fear?

273
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,910
Then in my next video I'm gonna talk exactly about that.

274
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
How do you overcome the fears of speaking in front of executives.

275
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,430
That video is coming right up next.

276
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
I'll see you there.
