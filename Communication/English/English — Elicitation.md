# Elicitation

## What is

Elicitation = elisitasi. Kalo dari KBBI adalah usaha mendapatkan sesuatu; perolehan.

Kalo dari makna kata elicitation inggris sendiri artinya proses yang dipake buat menarik informasi atau tanggapan dari seseorang. Jadi dari pengertiannya sendiri bukan "mengumpulkan", tapi "menarik". Secara umum, elisitasi dipake sewaktu kita perlu mengumpulkan informasi yang detailed dan spesifik dari individu atau kelompok. Ini adalah metode inquiry (pertanyaan atau permintaan) yang bisa disesuaiin tergantung fields dan konteks.



## Based-on fields

1. **Requirements Engineering**: In software development, elicitation is used to gather requirements from stakeholders. This could involve interviews, surveys, or workshops to understand what the software needs to do.

2. **Linguistics**: In linguistics, elicitation can be used to gather data about a language, for example by asking a native speaker how to say certain phrases.

3. **Cognitive Psychology**: In cognitive psychology, elicitation might be used to understand a person's thought processes or beliefs.

4. **Market Research**: In market research, elicitation techniques might be used to understand consumer preferences and behaviors.



## Differences with Requirement Gathering

1. **Elicitation**: This is the process of drawing out information from stakeholders. It involves various techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation. The goal of elicitation is to understand the needs and constraints of the stakeholders in order to define the requirements for the system.

2. **Requirement Gathering**: This is a broader term that encompasses elicitation. Requirement gathering involves not only elicitation but also other activities such as documenting the requirements, validating them with stakeholders, and managing changes to the requirements over time.

In other words, elicitation is a part of requirement gathering. Elicitation is about understanding and drawing out the needs of the stakeholders, while requirement gathering is about managing the entire lifecycle of the requirements, from elicitation to documentation, validation, and management. Both are crucial for the successful development of a software system. They are used in different situations depending on the stage of the software development process. Elicitation is typically used in the early stages when the requirements are being defined, while requirement gathering is a continuous process that happens throughout the development lifecycle.
