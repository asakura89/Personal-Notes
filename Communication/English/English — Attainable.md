# Attainable

The words "attainable" and "achievable" are often used interchangeably, but they have some subtle differences in meaning and usage. According to the web search results, here are some of the main differences:

•  Achievable means capable of being accomplished, while attainable means able to be reached or obtained. Achievable is about possibility, while attainable is about accessibilityhttps://wikidiff.com/achievable/attainable.

•  Achievable goals are realistic and practical, and they can be broken down into smaller steps that lead to the ultimate objective. Attainable goals are not only realistic and practical, but they are also within reach and do not require extraordinary efforts or resourceshttps://wikidiff.com/achievable/attainable.

•  Achievable is an adjective that describes something that can be done with effort, resources, and time. Attainable is also an adjective, but it can also be a noun that refers to anything that can be attainedhttps://thecontentauthority.com/blog/achievable-vs-attainable.

For example, running a marathon may be achievable for someone who is physically fit, but it may not be attainable for someone who has a disability that prevents them from running. Losing 10 pounds in a month may be achievable, but it may not be attainable if you have a busy schedule or health issues that prevent you from exercising or following a strict diet.
