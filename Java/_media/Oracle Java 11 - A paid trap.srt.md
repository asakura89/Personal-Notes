1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
as said by the great turtle in the great

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,460
movie kungfu panda and news is just news

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,830
there is no such thing as good news or

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,800
bad news but this is bad news hey there

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,450
everyone face year back again to another

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,889
video and in this video we are talking

7
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,490
about one bad news hate that it's me to

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,800
break out this bad news and address it

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,189
properly it's it's really bad news now

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,019
you might have seen the update if you

11
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,519
haven't seen that let me make it

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,160
officially that Java 11 is not gonna be

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:29,640
free

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,980
it's gonna be paid but it's not that

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,809
much bad as it looks like yes it's

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,820
definitely bad but it's not that much

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,190
bad so let me just break it down into

18
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,110
the things so that you can understand

19
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,360
this thing properly if you remember from

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,890
my previous videos on my youtube channel

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,870
from the archive of this youtube channel

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,120
I have mentioned this in the past that

23
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,100
this lawsuit this court case between

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,590
Google and Oracle is gonna turn up

25
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,170
pretty bad for every single developer

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,190
and it is now Oracle is already known as

27
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,649
very aggressive company when it comes to

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:03,300
these lawsuits and copyright

29
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,369
infringement and all of that I have seen

30
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,990
some of my friends who are other fellow

31
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,970
instructors some other great platforms

32
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,979
don't want to name them but they have

33
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,900
seen these copyright strikes just

34
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,990
because they have used Java logo in

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,030
their courses of course they are not

36
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,830
allowed to use so but they are not doing

37
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,630
anything with that but still they have

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,340
got copyright notices for that and they

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,380
have changed the image of their courses

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,299
so this is the status as of now for the

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,159
company the company has a well

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,170
reputation for being too much aggressive

43
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,960
and they are just following their marks

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,270
now the obvious question is hey fish if

45
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,790
Java 11 is paid how am I able to

46
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,950
download it for free I went on to the

47
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,320
JDK 11 download page it's available

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
there and I'm able to download it

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,520
install it and even run that properly so

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,500
how come is it paid my friend my

51
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,479
programmer buddy a great point you have

52
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,329
mentioned it there yes Java 11 is

53
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:57,119
totally free to download install but you

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,700
might have noticed a small yellow box on

55
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,860
to the download page that yes the

56
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,750
licensing are getting changed and

57
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,030
licensing my dear friends is a very

58
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,970
complicated topic and now let's get on

59
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,169
to the computer and first talk about

60
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,750
what are the changes that Oracle has

61
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,770
made in their licensing

62
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,470
and what for what thing Java is now

63
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,360
available for free and for what things

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,270
it's not so what you do when it comes to

65
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,340
download the Java install it and release

66
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,590
a production thing or just make an

67
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,540
amazing product like that you simply go

68
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,550
on to your browser just search for that

69
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,430
or rack link and just simply go ahead

70
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,410
and download JDK install that use in

71
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,300
production but you forgot to do one

72
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,160
thing now usually the case is if you're

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
in a mac or windows you just click on

74
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,730
this you accept the license and you

75
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,230
click on that and it will prompt you to

76
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,600
download and this is the usual inertia

77
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,940
everybody just goes onto this path and

78
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,430
probably what is going to happen now you

79
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,840
might download that you might use that

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,760
in production you might be happy with

81
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,530
your product and a lot of businesses are

82
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,030
using that you're making good money with

83
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,100
that paying your staff office trend and

84
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,720
everything but one day you get a call

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,670
from the license team of Oracle and

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,650
asking hey just we want two hundred

87
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,970
thousand dollars would you like to give

88
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,860
it us you say no then shut down your

89
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,170
company it might happen it might happen

90
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,450
it's nothing like nothing out of the

91
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,030
blue so notice here it says important

92
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,130
changes in Oracle JDK 11 license

93
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,810
obviously they are saying that hey there

94
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,760
are some license agreement changes so

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,110
here's the new license you can just

96
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,450
click on that and I'm not doing anything

97
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,890
I'm just showing you the information

98
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,480
which is already available so I can

99
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,970
surely zoom that in a little bit and I

100
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,680
can say and specify some of the

101
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,720
highlights of the points further you may

102
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,120
not use the program for any data

103
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,820
processing or any commercial production

104
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,180
or internal business purpose other than

105
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,570
developing testing prototyping and

106
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,220
demonstrating your application remember

107
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,230
the point you can use it for developing

108
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,840
testing and prototyping and

109
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,520
demonstrating your application remove or

110
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,610
modify any program making markings or

111
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,370
any notices of Oracle or a licensers

112
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,500
proprietary rights and you can read the

113
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,160
rest of the stuff yeah surely there are

114
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,570
a lot of things where the license is

115
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,180
pretty small pretty understandable and

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,070
the important part is just here so I

117
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,660
highly recommend you to go on to this

118
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,270
page read it to yourself and stay out of

119
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,820
trouble this inertia just flowing of

120
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,140
downloading the thing using in the

121
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,988
production mail and up into pretty bad

122
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:24,479
situations so hey be little bit careful

123
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,250
there so as you have seen in the license

124
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,500
yes things are getting pretty tricky and

125
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,080
they cannot it is not like I can explain

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
that in just one short video I need to

127
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,730
compile a ton of information need to

128
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,290
consult with a lot of my friends and

129
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,760
have to see what is going to be the

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,340
foreseen future of the Java but does

131
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,230
this mean that you can stop learning

132
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,970
Java no not at all just keep on learning

133
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,070
keep on going because obviously things

134
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,990
keep on rolling keep on changing in that

135
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,240
dire industry it's a common thing it

136
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,740
happens quite a lot but this one is

137
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,050
pretty impactful and obviously I will be

138
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,760
making more videos to make you update

139
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,140
about what is the situation right now

140
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,030
how things are gonna turn up in the

141
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,220
future and a lot more detail like this

142
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,380
am I worried about this future change

143
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,690
that is about to be there I would say

144
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,940
yes little bit and little bit worried on to

145
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,590
the side but yes a lot of people are

146
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,960
gonna be shifted on to the open JDK now

147
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,790
they will look forward to move there and

148
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,370
a lot of things are there a lot of lot

149
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,990
post are gonna come about to come up

150
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,510
they will release cycles a lot of things

151
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,220
are getting changed here but let me just

152
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,140
be assured that it's not like things are

153
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,160
gonna change overnight

154
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,290
shortly they're gonna be changing a lot

155
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,160
from the very new year 2019 but whatever

happens I'll keep you updated on this

let's see how the future rolls up but

159
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,979
one thing is pretty sure that Java 11 is

160
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,380
gonna be the changer the game changer in

161
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,340
the entire IT industry 2019 it can be

162
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,820
