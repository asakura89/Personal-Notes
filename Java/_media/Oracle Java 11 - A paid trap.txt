00:00:00	as said by the great turtle in the great movie cuckoo panda and news is just news there is no such thing as good news or bad news but this is bad news hey there everyone face year back again to another video and in this video we are talking about one bad news hate that it's me to break out this bad news and address it properly it's it's really bad news now you might have seen the update if you haven't seen that let me make it officially that Java 11 is not gonna be free it's gonna be paid but it's not that

00:00:32	much bad as it looks like yes it's definitely bad but it's not that much bad so let me just break it down into the things so that you can understand this thing properly if you remember from my previous videos on my youtube channel from the archive of this youtube channel I have mentioned this in the past that this lawsuit this court case between Google and Oracle is gonna turn up pretty bad for every single developer and it is now Oracle is already known as very aggressive company when it comes to

00:01:02	these lawsuits and copyright infringement and all of that I have seen some of my friends who are other fellow instructors some other great platforms don't want to name them but they have seen these copyright strikes just because they have used Java logo in their courses of course they are not allowed to use so but they are not doing anything with that but still they have got copyright notices for that and they have changed the image of their courses so this is the status as of now for the company the company has a well

00:01:29	reputation for being too much aggressive and they are just following their marks now the obvious question is hey fish if Java 11 is paid how am I able to download it for free I went on to the JDK 11 download page it's available there and I'm able to download it install it and even run that properly so how come is it paid my friend my programmer buddy a great point you have mentioned it there yes Java 11 is totally free to download install but you might have noticed a small yellow box on to the download page that yes the

00:02:02	licensing are getting changed and licensing my dear friends is a very complicated topic and now let's get on to the computer and first talk about what are the changes that Oracle has made in their life and what for what thing Java is now available for free and for what things it's not so what you do when it comes to download the Java install it and release a production thing or just make an amazing product like that you simply go on to your browser just search for that or rack link and just simply go ahead

00:02:32	and download JDK install that use in production but you forgot to do one thing now usually the case is if you're an americorps windows you just click on this you accept the license and you click on that and it will prompt you to download and this is the usual inertia everybody just goes onto this path and probably what is going to happen now you might download that you might use that in production you might be happy with your product and a lot of businesses are using that you're making good money with

00:02:57	that paying your staff office trend and everything but one day you get a call from the licensed team of Oracle and asking hey just we want two hundred thousand dollars would you like to give it us you say no then shut down your company it might happen it might happen it's nothing like nothing out of the blue so notice here it says important changes in Oracle JDK 11 license obviously they are saying that hey there are some license agreement changes so here's the new license you can just click on that and I'm not doing anything

00:03:24	I'm just showing you the information which is already available so I can surely zoom that in a little bit and I can say and specify some of the highlights of the points further you may not use the program for any data processing or any commercial production or internal business purpose other than developing testing prototyping and demonstrating your application remember the point you can use it for developing testing and prototyping and demonstrating your application remove or modify any program making markings or

00:03:57	any notices of Arrakis or a licensers proprietary rights and you can read the rest of the stuff yeah surely there are a lot of things where the license is pretty small pretty understandable and the important part is just here so I highly recommend you to go on to this page read it to yourself and stay out of trouble this inertia just flowing of downloading the thing using in the production mail and up into pretty bad situations so hey be little bit careful there so as you have seen in the license

00:04:27	yes things are getting pretty tricky and they cannot it is not like I can explain that in just one short video I need to compile a ton of information need to consult with a lot of my friends and have to see what is going to be the foreseen future of the Java but does this mean that you can stop learning Java no not at all just keep on learning keep on going because obviously things keep on rolling keep on changing in that dire industry it's a common thing it happens quite a lot but this one is pretty impactful and obviously I will be

00:04:56	making more videos to make you update about what is the situation right now how things are gonna turn up in the future and a lot more detail like this am I worried about this future change that is about to be there I would say yes little bit unlit a bit worried on to the side but yes a lot of people are gonna be shifted on to the open JDK now they will look forward to move there and a lot of things are there a lot of lot post are gonna come about to come up they will release cycles a lot of things

00:05:23	are getting changed here but let me just be assured that it's not like things are gonna change overnight shortly they're gonna be changing a lot from the very new year 2019 but whatever happens I'll keep you updated on this particular matter specially the Java and let's see how the future rolls up but one thing is pretty sure that Java 11 is gonna be the changer the game changer in the entire IT industry 2019 it can be really really a shaky start Oracle what have you done so that's it for this video in case you have enjoyed this
