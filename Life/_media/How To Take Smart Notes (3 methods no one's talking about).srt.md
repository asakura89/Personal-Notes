1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,066
Illusion of competence.

2
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:02,768
So you read an actionable,
insightful book.

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,304
You learn visually by highlighting the key
points and underlying the key words.

4
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,423
or maybe 5 minutes later,
if you're like me,

5
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:12,458
you try to tell your loved
ones, your friends or family

6
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,061
about all these amazing things
that you've learned.

7
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:16,729
But there's that awkward pause...

8
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,532
Why can't I explain what I just learned?

9
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:21,701
What was that idea again?!
This happens to the best of us.

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,570
It's called the illusion of competence.

11
00:00:26,273 --> 00:00:27,273
The gist of it is all that underlining,
all that highlighting,

12
00:00:29,376 --> 00:00:30,376
all that note taking is giving us
the illusion that we're learning

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
something new while our brain
is just relaxing like a potato.

14
00:00:36,183 --> 00:00:37,183
So how to fix it?

15
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:38,184
One way is to take smart notes.

16
00:00:39,253 --> 00:00:40,253
Actually, no air quotes.

17
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:41,554
These notes are actually smart.

18
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:43,189
This is how Leonardo da Vinci took notes.

19
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,091
You know, the polymath genius
who invented tanks, made scientific

20
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:48,427
discoveries in astronomy,
civil engineering, zoology, geometry,

21
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,565
and had time to paint on the side,
like the Last Supper and the Mona Lisa.

22
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:56,402
Niklas Luhmann also used smart notes
and published more than 70 books

23
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:00,339
and almost 400 articles on the economy,

24
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:03,209
lore, politics, art, religion, media
and even love.

25
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:06,279
So if you want to become
a powerful thinker,

26
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:08,314
or you just want to remember
the things that you've learned,

27
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,850
smart Notes is going to help you do that.

28
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:16,355
There
are 3 things that make smart notes smart.

29
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:18,991
The first one is smart notes are active,
meaning that they're not passive

30
00:01:21,762 --> 00:01:22,762
highlights, underlines and notes
that just follow the author's flow.

31
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:27,233
Instead, it's about actively restructuring
other people's thoughts

32
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:30,570
into your own structure.

33
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:31,971
Now, you might ask, Well,
what is my structure?

34
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Well, if you don't already have one,
here's a great one to get started:

35
00:01:36,543 --> 00:01:37,543
It's called Q/E/C. Q/E/C.

36
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:39,645
It stands for Question, Evidence
and Conclusion.

37
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:42,081
This is what I used in law school
Even if you are not studying for law,

38
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:45,484
this still works because Professor
Cal Newport from Georgetown

39
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:49,021
University, who's written
lots of books on a deep work on time

40
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:52,859
blocking on digital productivity,
he uses this method, and actually

41
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:56,963
he was the one that named this the Q/E/C
Note-Taking method.

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
You look for only 3 things

43
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,368
when you're reading: the questions,
the evidence and the conclusion.

44
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,272
This way

45
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:06,739
it doesn't matter what you're reading,
which order the author puts his ideas in.

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,910
You can always find these three things
and link them together.

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,080
Professor Newport even has a system
for identifying them while you read.

48
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:18,451
For any conclusions, ideas,
you put a dot next to it.

49
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:21,754
For the evidence and examples,
you put a dash across it.

50
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:24,757
And when you review your notes,
you think about which question

51
00:02:27,027 --> 00:02:28,027
are these ideas trying to answer
and which evidence links to these ideas.

52
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:32,632
Let me give you a quick example
with the book Atomic Habits.

53
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,134
James Clear,
like his name, he's a very clear writer.

54
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,070
So, many of his headings
are actually already questions.

55
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
Then you go down the page and you look
for new ideas and put a dot next to them.

56
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,512
He gives great examples and anecdotes,
so you put a dash across them.

57
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,283
Once you've finished reading a section,
then you can put all these notes together.

58
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:53,953
Start with question, give the evidence
and write the conclusion down.

59
00:02:56,189 --> 00:02:57,189
This is how it can look like.
Now, most people stop here, right?

60
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:00,059
I've got the question.

61
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:00,993
I've got the evidence
I've got the conclusion.

62
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:03,062
What more do I need? A-ha.

63
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:04,764
This is where you are
going to outsmart others.

64
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:07,233
Because the next thing about smart notes
is that they are atomic.

65
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:11,003
The size of your notes
and the ideas on them matter.

66
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,907
When other people are organizing
their notes in one giant document,

67
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:18,244
whether digitally or in notebook,
you do something different.

68
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,981
You make your notes atomic.

69
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:23,816
This is a classic example
of how tools actually

70
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:26,819
shape and limit how you can think.

71
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,221
Think about it.

72
00:03:28,822 --> 00:03:29,822
If you use a giant word doc,
how do you think?

73
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:32,191
You think vertically, right?

74
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:33,326
You think chronologically,
you think A, then B, then C.

75
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,429
If you take away A and C, all of a sudden
you can't really remember what was B.

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
But if you use atomic ideas
not in one giant document, but each idea

77
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,670
stands alone by itself,
then you can think in 3D, right?

78
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,541
You can think up and down, left to right.

79
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:50,643
You can think diagonally.

80
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,011
You can think about this pile
and that pile.

81
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:54,347
All of a sudden your ideas come alive.

82
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,149
This is what Charlie Munger
was talking about

83
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:58,951
when he said "The first rule
is that you can't really know anything

84
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:02,221
if you just remember isolate the facts
and try and bang 'em back.

85
00:04:04,324 --> 00:04:05,324
If the facts don't hang together
on a latticework of theory,

86
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:08,861
don't have them in a usable form."
So once you've got your Q/E/C's,

87
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:12,932
you want each Q, each
E, each C - each question, each evidence,

88
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:17,603
each conclusion to be its own atomic note,

89
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
because in the next step
we are going to rearrange them.

90
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,510
Especially if you're using
the Zettelkasten method,

91
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,679
making your ideas atomic
is going to make all the difference.

92
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:29,749
Because the third thing that makes smart
notes smart is that they are connected,

93
00:04:33,286 --> 00:04:34,286
which means one, we've already connected
ideas with the Q/E/C method.

94
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,990
But there's a two,

95
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,658
which is outside of these new things

96
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
that you've learned,
you also want to connect new ideas

97
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,096
to existing ideas, things
that you already know.

98
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,033
This is how we will combat
the illusion of competence.

99
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:50,403
The way to get out of the illusion

100
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:52,238
is to make sure you're latching
your new ideas onto existing ones.

101
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:55,975
And how do you do that?

102
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:57,009
You can try the compass
of the Zettelkasten thinking.

103
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,545
I learned this one from my friend Fei.

104
00:05:00,147 --> 00:05:01,147
You take one idea in the middle and
you think in four different directions.

105
00:05:04,684 --> 00:05:05,684
North is: Where does this idea come from?

106
00:05:07,654 --> 00:05:08,654
West is: What's similar to this idea?

107
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:11,357
East is: What competes with this idea?

108
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,959
And South is:
Where can this idea link to next?

109
00:05:15,762 --> 00:05:16,762
Let me give you an example
from Atomic Habits again.

110
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,231
"You do not rise
to the level of your goals.

111
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
You fall to the level of your systems."
Let's use that as the main idea.

112
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,671
Okay, so let's go north.

113
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:27,139
Where does this idea come from?

114
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:28,908
Well, James Clear says it comes from goal
oriented thinking that most of us do.

115
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:33,145
But the problem is that winners and losers
have the same goals, right?

116
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:37,249
So what's different?

117
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:38,784
It's the systems they set that
help them achieve those goals.

118
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,354
Okay, then let's go West.

119
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:44,757
What's similar to this idea of don't
focus on goals, focus on the system?

120
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:48,861
Well, systems
thinking is exactly about this idea.

121
00:05:51,098 --> 00:05:52,098
I've talked about it in detail here.

122
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,599
But the gist is
that you want to troubleshoot a system

123
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:56,669
to make sure that you're
reaching your eventual goal.

124
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,138
So just like how we manage
large organizations,

125
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,341
we can apply similar principles
in our habit formations.

126
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:05,945
Okay, then let's go east.

127
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:07,346
What competes with this idea
of focus on systems, not goals?

128
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:10,649
What's opposite?

129
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,584
What's missing?

130
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:12,885
Well,
we can say that goal setting is important.

131
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:15,721
Right.

132
00:06:14,921 --> 00:06:15,921
It gives us a direction to go towards and
then have the system that get you there.

133
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:19,892
But if your goals are wrong
and you are on the wrong trajectory,

134
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:23,696
then it doesn't matter
how good your system is,

135
00:06:24,498 --> 00:06:25,498
you're not going to get to
where you want to go.

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Goal setting has to happen first,
but then you need the systems.

137
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:30,803
All right, then, let's go south.

138
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:32,671
Where does the idea of goals and systems
lead to?

139
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,875
Well, as James Clear said himself,
is not just about forming good habits.

140
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,812
It's also about breaking bad habits.

141
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:42,248
Forming atomic habits has helped people
with addiction, with weight loss goals.

142
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,385
Coming back to systems
thinking and larger organizations.

143
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:49,889
Maybe we can apply the same principles
and help organizations break bad habits

144
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,493
like problems in diversity,
like protecting the environment.

145
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,230
Wow. Just by thinking
in four different directions,

146
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:00,533
we're coming up with ways to solve
climate change and diversity issues.

147
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:03,769
Connecting ideas is essential.

148
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,671
And if you want to take your smart note,
taking to the next level,

149
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,374
then make sure you check out
my Zettelkasten guide

150
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:10,476
and I'll see you in the next one. Bye!
