1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,799
okay so Jonathan Blow made this man quit

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
his job for real all right let's listen

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,240
to this what would I say to someone

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,280
starting their programming career at a

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,120
web company using JavaScript okay I'm

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,559
very serious about

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,720
this okay so every single person who is

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,800
listening has pretty much just got

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,480
called out and is ready to get stomped

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,680
on okay so everybody are you ready are

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,680
you

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,440
ready find a better job immediate

13
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:35,520
Get Wrecked

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,719
imately where you are not using

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,879
JavaScript

16
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,680
because this will affect your long-term

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,039
development as a programmer the

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,559
beginning of your career when you're

19
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:47,879
young and have a lot of

20
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,320
energy is very

21
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,840
important you need to use it effectively

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,079
because it'll determine your trajectory

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,320
for the rest of your life okay if I

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,920
actually really liked this take I know

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,160
JavaScript is recommended as The

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,800
Beginner's language

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,760
but there is something very valuable

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,320
about struggling I remember my first

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,080
couple years were spent on robots and

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,080
there was a lot of struggle it's where I

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,960
learned and loved printf debugging uh

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,320
it's where I've I developed a lot of the

33
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,920
ways I do things now is because of it um

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,759
there's definitely some very good parts

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,680
to this that he's absolutely right on

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,680
your desire and your ability to push

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,360
through difficult things is definitely

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
going to be proportional to how excited

39
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,280
you are and people typically are more

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,799
excited when they're young

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360
just real talk you're just you genuinely

42
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,119
are more excited when you're young than

43
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,799
when you're older not saying that's

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,759
always true for everybody but I think we

45
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,360
can agree that that's generally true if

46
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,200
you start a career at a company that

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,680
gives you mediocre things to do you're

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,560
GNA turn yourself into a mediocre web

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,240
programmer that's just what happens okay

50
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,759
you need to go outside that do anything

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,759
go work at

52
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,159
SpaceX go intern at SpaceX and bring

53
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:06,360
people [ __ ] coffee that'll be better

54
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,440
for your career long term than doing web

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,599
development at a web company okay that

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,599
is a bold ass

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,959
statement I want to think about that

58
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,560
more because I think I I I mean

59
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,400
generally I understand the logic which

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,440
is the more challenging and the more

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
difficult the things you have to solve

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,640
on The

63
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Daily the more you're going to rise to

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,319
the

65
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,280
occasion I think that makes

66
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,440
sense SpaceX is known for being

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,319
intensely difficult so I I get the I get

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,920
the idea like I'm I'm definitely not

69
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,879
dunking on his idea now I know some

70
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,680
people hate that they just hate the Elon

71
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,120
so they can't they can't even they can't

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,400
hear the concept right they hear the

73
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,280
word Elon and they're just

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,640
like like I don't care and so I can I

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
can I'm going try to eat the fish and

76
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,560
spit the bones here uh it's just a

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,799
different way of saying that you should

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,360
always be the dumbest person in the room

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:15,560
sort of sort of the that's a very hard

80
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,000
I've never liked that phrase

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,519
either I've never liked the phrase like

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
don't be the smartest person in the room

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,400
or be the dumbest person in the room or

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,920
whatever because inevitably it leads to

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,760
all rooms being

86
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:32,879
empty um meaning that people will

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,239
constantly use like how often are you if

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,640
you are the smartest person in the room

89
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,400
should you quit well the problem is is

90
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
that I mean think about all the you know

91
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,519
you the the problem with that statement

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,040
is that no place could ever survive

93
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,080
purely on that

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,799
mentality right once you become the best

95
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,720
you just have to move on now I just

96
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,720
typically am just the dumbest by just by

97
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,560
the sheer Dent of who I am um

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,720
nonetheless Jonathan Blow you can't

99
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
really make fun of him for using Windows

100
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,360
uh he also was using uh he was a heavy

101
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,879
heavy Unix man in the 80s and early 90s

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,640
so I don't I don't think I don't think

103
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,799
you're going to win that argument per

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,280
se just

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,040
saying again my rant about impostor

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,280
syndrome is it's not so there is a real

107
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,919
psychological Effect called impostor

108
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,639
syndrome but that's not what everybody

109
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,919
on the Internet is talking about right o

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
I cannot wait for this I cannot wait for

111
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,639
Twitter Twitter shambles here we go

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,440
people Twitter shames you're not even

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,000
good enough to have impostor

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,000
syndrome people on the internet seized

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,240
that

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,080
name and used it inappropriately for

117
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,520
their accurate feeling that they don't

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,520
know what they're doing at their job

119
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
okay did you just hear what he just said

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,520
the accurate feeling of you not knowing

121
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,320
what you're doing because you are

122
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,039
accurately un because you are not act

123
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:11,680
you're not an impostor you are just not

124
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:17,199
qualified

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:20,720
no oh no diagnosis skill issue

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,000
syndrome okay most people are bad at

127
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,120
their job and don't know what they're

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,600
doing that's not a

129
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,680
syndrome that's an accurate depiction of

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,720
the situation and so to pretend it's not

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,639
true people want to pretend it's not

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
true that they're bad at their job they

133
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,400
want to pretend that they're actually

134
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,120
good and it's just a mental issue it's

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,639
just confidence or something right no

136
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,400
it's just you're if you're bad at your

137
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,479
job and your brain is telling you you're

138
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,080
bad at your

139
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,639
job then just pay attention to that and

140
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,080
try to figure out how to get better the

141
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,039
more I actually really did like that

142
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,560
take that that was honestly a really

143
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,759
great take

144
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,479
if you think you're bad at your

145
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,759
job you should be trying to analyze

146
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,000
which parts you're bad at and how to get

147
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,160
better right like that's actually that's

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,759
that's like just genuinely great

149
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:24,160
advice that's genuinely good ass advice

150
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:27,319
go crack open a book get better and

151
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,560
now I mean it's it's shockingly

152
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,000
shockingly great the inverse of that

153
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,120
also is that someone believed in you

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,759
enough to hire you to set you in that

155
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,280
seat despite knowing your

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,039
experience meaning that they think you

157
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,880
can do it so if you just put those two

158
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,720
things

159
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,639
together you know what I mean I'm just

160
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,800
saying you

161
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:55,599
should you should be able to do this

162
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,039
time you spend working in that space of

163
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,759
your approximation to the thing that you

164
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:03,599
want the more time time you you spend

165
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,400
becoming an expert in the field of this

166
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,879
specific application that you're making

167
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,800
the better you get at that subfield of

168
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,919
programming and the better you get at

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,479
that subfield the better you're decision

170
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:18,400
making about technical issues in that

171
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,520
field is going to be so if you make I do

172
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,520
think that this completely goes away

173
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,000
when we're talking about front-end

174
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,400
Frameworks because they keep inventing

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,160
them so they just keep getting better at

176
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,960
creating more and more abstraction so

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,360
I'm not sure if that that is always

178
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,720
true but I guess it is true they are

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,479
better at creating abstractions but is

180
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,599
it actually better I don't know hard

181
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,000
decisions

182
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:46,120
later they will be made better both by a

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,080
more skilled person and with more

184
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,280
contextual information than if you make

185
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,960
those hard decisions early on okay so

186
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,560
deferring these kind of decisions is

187
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,039
actually important for good

188
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,879
craftsmanship in some cases it sounds

189
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:04,120
paradoxical because you would think good

190
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,800
craftsmanship is just you see a problem

191
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,800
and you like relentlessly solve it

192
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,440
whenever you see one but I don't find it

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,639
to work that way for new program I

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,120
actually really I actually really like

195
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,800
that take a whole bunch there is

196
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,240
something about just time in the saddle

197
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,919
that is just one of the most important

198
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,000
parts of your day job just seeing the

199
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,400
same problem four times you can do a

200
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,199
really really really really good job

201
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,479
your fourth time and it also kind of

202
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,440
goes to show that you should write

203
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,360
software in such a way that you have to

204
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,760
kind of plan for its longevity like if

205
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,200
you know it's not going to be a super

206
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,279
long piece of software or you know

207
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,200
you're going to have time to kind of

208
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,000
rethink some of your assumptions and

209
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,360
then it's better to get the speed to get

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,640
the experience to understand what you're

211
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
building than it is to just try to solve

212
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,760
it correct the first time you know

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,160
there's definitely there's definitely

214
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,600
like there's definitely a a Gambit you

215
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,640
have to play here gramers what would I

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,160
broadly say about choosing a career path

217
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
in programming the same thing I always

218
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,279
say not time in Seattle time in in the

219
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,600
saddle okay you don't want to spend any

220
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,519
time in Seattle okay you're going to get

221
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,240
mugged you're going to

222
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,600
die which is be careful what you choose

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,800
especially when you're very young

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,959
because when you're

225
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,480
young it's the time when you're really

226
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:17,399
learning and the time when you're still

227
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,600
defining yourself I mean you're always

228
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,959
still defining yourself but when you're

229
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,000
young you're especially doing that

230
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,680
because you have less history behind you

231
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,800
and so if you go somewhere

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,360
mediocre and you learn from people who

233
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,320
are doing mediocre work

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,519
you're going to be defining yourself as

235
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,040
someone who doesn't do things that are

236
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:39,200
particularly good or particularly

237
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,920
special that's just reality people don't

238
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,920
like it when I say that that way but

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,920
that just is what it is that's what

240
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
happens um if you're lucky you can break

241
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,680
yourself out of that later but better

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,200
never to be in that

243
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:58,360
situation

244
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,600
so choose where you work and who you

245
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,480
work with very carefully because there

246
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,560
hasn't been selection that's very very

247
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,320
good piece of advice right there

248
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,839
honestly uh I actually said no to a

249
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,360
masters because I did not respect the

250
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,600
person who was giving me Masters at a

251
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,600
full ride free everything and I said no

252
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:24,320
um and the reason was exactly that which

253
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,040
was that no matter what you become like

254
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,040
who you spend your time

255
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
with

256
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:36,480
and so I I I wanted to be very careful

257
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,880
about that and so I am careful about who

258
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,519
I spend my time with and that's one of

259
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,000
those things because no matter what no

260
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:44,440
matter how much you no matter how much

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,920
you you don't want it to be true you

262
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,680
will be like the people you surround

263
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,079
yourself with that's not true what's not

264
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,200
true you don't ever become anything like

265
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,519
you don't become like the people you

266
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,880
surround yourself

267
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,880
with not

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Trill I am smarter

269
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,600
than Aristotle and Solomon and everybody

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,839
else behind me who's ever existed who's

271
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,399
written about

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,320
this you can decide um Good

273
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,760
Luck Good luck with that one it's your

274
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,160
decision yeah again good luck with that

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,560
one good luck with that

276
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,040
one way to fight against like just

277
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,600
Collective

278
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,560
human and wisdom for for 3,000 years

279
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,480
plus in writing yeah don't worry I'm

280
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,560
better than that one this is what we

281
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,560
refer to as a skill

282
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:44,720
issue good luck Sten good luck pressure

283
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,639
on programming culture whether or not

284
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,120
you believe me about whether the current

285
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,800
culture is right or not you could at

286
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,160
least expect that there's not that much

287
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
reason for it to be right there's like a

288
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,160
very mild constraint that your program

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
does kind of have to run and that's a

290
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
reality check but that's getting looser

291
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,079
all the time anyway like look at how

292
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,440
many more and more programmers are hired

293
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,440
just to make a simple program run now

294
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,480
right like people people spend years at

295
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,040
web companies working on individual web

296
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,839
pages that are about the complexity of

297
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,279
something I would program in basic when

298
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,279
I was in high school in like

299
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,480
a I mean this is one of the problems of

300
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,959
abstractions we we've we've tried to

301
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,279
make everything abstract everything fall

302
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,639
into these various patterns and we just

303
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,760
don't do the obvious thing which is the

304
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,880
straightforward thing which is just

305
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
build the actual thing instead of

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,880
building all these abstractions around

307
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,880
it like you don't have to have a

308
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,600
generalized everything sometimes you can

309
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,600
just build the

310
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,600
thing couple weeks or a week or

311
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,880
something right it's just crazy at this

312
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,320
point I think it's still possible to

313
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,240
Pivot later oh we're back we're back

314
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,880
here okay we're back here this whatever

315
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,079
this graphic is he has some spicy takes

316
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,440
on whatever this graphic

317
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
is on in life to try and pursue what you

318
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,680
feel is your true passion while taking

319
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
more financially stable choice in the

320
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,920
present no I think people tell

321
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
themselves all the time they're going to

322
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,720
do that and then they just age into

323
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,480
their financially stable

324
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,959
Choice that's just what

325
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,720
happens

326
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,600
um I

327
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,360
think I think either you're willing to

328
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,279
take risks or you're not

329
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,959
and your propensity for taking risks

330
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:37,800
will only be reduced as you age you'll

331
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:39,920
never this is very true you know it's

332
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,680
not like you get 10 years older and feel

333
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,959
like way more radical than you did when

334
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,920
you were 23 that's not how that works

335
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:50,600
okay really doesn't when you're 43

336
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,160
you'll have way way more reasons to be

337
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,959
conservative than when you were 23 so if

338
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,920
you don't learn to take risks now you

339
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,880
will not do it

340
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,279
later if you have that's that's also

341
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,279
very good

342
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,240
advice very few people are different

343
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
than that and there's always going to be

344
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,639
a person that's like oh I'm way I'm way

345
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,639
more risk taking than I was when I was

346
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,959
23 now that I'm 43 um but

347
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,480
typically as you get older you get you

348
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,040
get more and more kind of you you you

349
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,440
you think about your choices and maybe

350
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
maybe it's not even risk-taking is the

351
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,839
right term maybe you're just more wise

352
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,079
to see that some risks aren't worth

353
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,959
taking

354
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,600
right some risks as you get older you'll

355
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,519
go oh yeah yeah that that doesn't that

356
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,720
just doesn't make any sense I'm better

357
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,800
and that's wisdom I mean that's just

358
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,320
generally wisdom right wisdom is not the

359
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,000
ability to solve a tough problem but

360
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,079
knowing which tough problem to solve

361
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,480
that's like an easy way to State it uh

362
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:48,040
and so like there's always a tough

363
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,480
problem there's always a risk you can

364
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,519
take but which risk is the right risk to

365
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,680
take and obviously having kids and

366
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,199
family and other financial

367
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
responsibilities you know you got to

368
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:59,480
think a little bit more about

369
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,519
it

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,759
have

371
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:07,480
money of any magnitude and you have a

372
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,839
theory about how to do something

373
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,759
productive then you should invest that

374
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,680
money in your own

375
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,480
Theory because it I mean if you believe

376
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,959
it has a good chance of being right

377
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,320
because you're most in control of that

378
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:25,639
and there are fewest middlemen skimming

379
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,690
off of that right so the highest return

380
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:29,800
comes from you investing that money in

381
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,759
[Music]

382
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,160
your own idea um so all these things

383
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,920
like putting it in an index fund or you

384
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,399
know a mutual fund or whatever or bonds

385
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,720
that's all he forgot housing for if you

386
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,120
don't have an

387
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,480
idea how to make any money which is fine

388
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,920
for people who don't want to have an

389
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,880
idea or don't want to take any risks but

390
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,720
if you

391
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,560
do there are better things to do the

392
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,319
people who I mean that's not terribly

393
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,759
bad advice

394
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,800
that's fine advice if you don't if you

395
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,319
don't want to take the risk yourself and

396
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
you'd rather try to put it into

397
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,000
something that's more stable and and

398
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,279
short there's there's different

399
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,880
Investments for each person index funds

400
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,360
are for Boomers uh yeah I mean I get

401
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,399
that people put their money into various

402
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,920
types of funds uh each fund has a

403
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,639
different level in it but he is right

404
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,040
like if you want the greatest potential

405
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,720
for every dollar you put in it is like

406
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,839
investing in yourself to create

407
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,079
something that you believe is better

408
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,160
than everybody else right

409
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:32,920
like if you believe you can create the

410
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,519
greatest version of Twitter whatever

411
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,720
that version is right I know there's

412
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,120
always a new version of Twitter that's

413
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,319
killing off Twitter Twitter's dying this

414
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,759
week it's going under maston's gonna get

415
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:45,240
it right I get it but if you think you

416
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,680
got that best one ever it is

417
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,199
better it is better for the potential

418
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,360
now the realization is where it all goes

419
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:54,240
wrong right that's where it all goes

420
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,040
wrong you might not realize anything and

421
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,160
lose all your money I realized negative

422
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:05,600
dollars when I did my last start up

423
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,600
potential huge realization

424
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,959
negative it

425
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,439
hurt do stuff that nobody else was doing

426
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,280
because the other people talk themselves

427
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,839
out of doing the thing right that's the

428
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,640
secret that you have to know everybody

429
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,199
is talking themselves out of success all

430
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,120
the time and I'm not trying to sound too

431
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,240
self-help Guru about that because

432
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,600
selfhelp people give me the

433
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,919
creepies but it's true agree with

434
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,240
everything people talk themselves out of

435
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,400
success every

436
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,280
day um it's weird like why would human

437
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,559
beings do that but they do it once you

438
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,160
learn to see it you see it all the time

439
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:45,160
all right but you need to stand out from

440
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,440
I like that I like that last one uh

441
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,840
there's a typical phrase that I think is

442
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,880
one of my favorite phrases I've ever

443
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,880
heard which is seizing defeat from the

444
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,600
clutches of Victory like I I I do see

445
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,880
this pretty regularly and kids are just

446
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,159
terrible at that they'll be doing

447
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,320
something right and then just like can't

448
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,120
help but to start doing the wrong thing

449
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,480
you're like you got it man just slow

450
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,120
down just don't do it it's just like it

451
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,039
just you can't even help it you can't

452
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,840
even help it you just watch it the rust

453
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
modotto it's the rust model rust

454
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,080
literally has everything to do the right

455
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,440
thing they just got to just what are you

456
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,880
doing what are what are you doing

457
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,640
Foundation how did you create the

458
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:28,159
craziest the the just the craziest setup

459
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,320
like what are they doing it's wild thank

460
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,320
you

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,039
other people in order to really succeed

462
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,000
at a lot of things and people are afraid

463
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:40,280
of standing out from other people

464
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,640
because when you stand out from the herd

465
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:49,440
you get taken down by a mountain lion or

466
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:51,440
whatever right um so people have strong

467
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,799
resistance to that certain people other

468
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,760
people don't right um people with high

469
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,360
risk

470
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,960
tolerance don't have those aversions to

471
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,600
the same degree and so

472
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,080
um you might be doing that I don't know

473
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't know you um I don't know what

474
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,000
your personality is like but you might

475
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,360
be doing that you might be just looking

476
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,039
for

477
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,840
ways to not succeed while thinking that

478
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,840
you tried your

479
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
hardest that is definitely a thing that

480
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,640
people

481
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,640
do for

482
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,200
me

483
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,320
me there's not that much question that

484
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,559
I'm going to finish the things that I do

485
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,880
because I've learned the secret of

486
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:41,799
that I should probably pay attention to

487
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,080
this section everybody pay attention um

488
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,640
finishing the things you start here we

489
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,039
go and the secret of that is you just do

490
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,039
the stuff that you say you're going to

491
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,320
do it literally is the secret there is

492
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,919
only one way to do the things you're

493
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,559
supposed to do is by by doing the things

494
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,840
you said you were going to do like

495
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,400
that's honestly that is that is as good

496
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,280
of advice as you'll ever

497
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,400
receive if you think that there's some

498
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,840
magic bullet to make you more likely to

499
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,240
S like to finish a

500
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,720
project

501
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,760
sorry the answer is just do

502
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,280
it it's really not hard but most people

503
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,039
don't do it right okay this is the sad

504
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,159
fact right most people are bad at

505
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,640
programming most people who are good at

506
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,720
programming are really

507
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,039
busy they're not usually the people

508
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,440
giving you advice about how to

509
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,880
program by sturgeon's

510
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:49,120
law almost all advice you will see on

511
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:53,480
the internet about how to program is bad

512
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,440
so I mean if you have absolutely no idea

513
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,440
how to

514
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,720
program then I guess you go on the

515
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,320
internet and you look look for a little

516
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,600
bit like enough to get traction but if

517
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,159
you know how to program a little

518
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,679
bit you probably know better than the

519
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:11,320
average advice on the internet all right

520
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,679
so what you need to then do is get

521
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,840
better so that you have enough judgment

522
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,080
capability to sift the good advice apart

523
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,559
from the bad advice and the only way to

524
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,880
do that is to

525
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:24,159
program I really I did I did actually

526
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,919
really like that I maybe maybe you

527
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,039
didn't maybe you didn't catch that one

528
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,039
which is

529
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,000
someone who is he started off by saying

530
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,960
someone who's good at programming is

531
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,159
really

532
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,440
busy and then goes into advice and what

533
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,080
he was saying is that when you're

534
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,400
listening to people who are regularly

535
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,039
giving out tons of free programming

536
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:50,240
advice and all

537
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,600
this you are listening to people that

538
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,600
aren't

539
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,600
busy which means by his definition there

540
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,039
you might not be listening to the best

541
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,039
advice

542
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,600
that's pretty good it's a it's a bit of

543
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:06,600
a funny

544
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,960
Paradox which means that whenever you're

545
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,720
getting

546
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:13,760
like how often do you get code

547
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,840
reviews and the people that seem to be

548
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,840
the most active on code

549
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,240
reviews uh

550
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,640
oh

551
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:28,520
[Music]

552
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
uhoh uhoh

553
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,400
uh I don't know I mean it's just it's an

554
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,039
interesting kind of paradox it's a it's

555
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,200
an interesting

556
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
problem

557
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,600
anyways you're not really the best since

558
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,880
you're here with us absolutely I'm not

559
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,279
the best how do you level up as a

560
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
programmer who's been primarily working

561
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:46,279
with web framework stop doing web

562
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,440
programming web programming is bad it

563
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:51,360
will make you a bad programmer stop it

564
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,120
work on other things in other domains

565
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,400
that is Step number

566
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,080
one I think that's good advice it's like

567
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:04,080
saying how do I become a better

568
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,919
athlete when what I do is I sit around

569
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,039
with all the guys on the couch with the

570
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,799
bags of Cheetos and we practice throwing

571
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,080
the Cheetos into each other's

572
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,559
Bowl which is kind of like playing

573
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,679
basketball and it's like

574
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,200
no just play

575
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:22,120
basketball that's that's

576
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,080
funny okay I like that I like that that

577
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,760
that the

578
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,000
analogy pretty funny but I like that I

579
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,440
actually like I generally I generally

580
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,440
like that whole

581
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,240
thing beer pong is a real sport is it I

582
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,760
get this [ __ ] all the time how do I get

583
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:44,400
better at Judo do more Judo dude it the

584
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,120
answer is almost always time in the

585
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,840
saddle anytime you hear someone how do I

586
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,200
get better at X they're almost never

587
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,880
asking you to say the simplest an

588
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,039
obvious answer which is just do the

589
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,720
thing that's how you get better okay

590
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,600
because yes there are some things that

591
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,279
you can't quite do that with like golf

592
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,159
you need to have someone show you the

593
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:09,159
right way to do it then you go do the

594
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,159
right way 10,000

595
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,360
times like that's just how it works is

596
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,480
that you have to have some hint as to

597
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:19,240
how to do better and then you just do it

598
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,880
constantly over and over again every day

599
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,200
always and that is actually what I'm

600
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
going to go do right now because I have

601
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,960
a very fantastic project that needs some

602
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,799
wrangling and I would like to do some

603
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,799
wrangling
