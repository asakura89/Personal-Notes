1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,560
what would I say to someone starting

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,640
their programming career at a web

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,599
company using JavaScript okay I'm very

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,639
serious about

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,719
this find a better job

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,920
immediately where you are not using

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,080
JavaScript

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,880
because this will affect your long-term

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,240
development as a programmer the

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,720
beginning of your career when you're

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,080
young and have a lot of

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,519
energy is very

13
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,039
important you need to use it effectively

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
because it'll determine your trajectory

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,280
for the rest of your life

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,120
okay if you start a career at a company

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,600
that gives you mediocre things to do

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,760
you're G to turn yourself into a

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,680
mediocre web

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,320
programmer that's just what happens okay

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,840
you need to go outside that do anything

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,840
go work at

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,239
SpaceX go intern at SpaceX and bring

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,440
people coffee that'll be better

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,920
for your career long term than doing web

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,120
development at a web company okay okay

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,159
again my rant about impostor syndrome is

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,400
it's not so there is a real

29
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,080
psychological Effect called impostor

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,439
syndrome but that's not what everybody

31
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,040
on the Internet is talking about right

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,240
people on the internet seized that

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,119
name and used it inappropriately for

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,880
their accurate feeling that they don't

35
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,680
know what they're doing at their job

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
okay most people are bad at their job

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,400
and don't know what they're doing that's

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,240
not a syndrome that's an accurate

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,520
depiction of the situation and so to

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,000
pretend it's not true people want to

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,880
pretend it's not true that they're bad

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,520
at their job they want to pretend that

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,960
they're actually good and it's just a

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,360
mental issue it's just confidence or

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,240
something right no it's just you're if

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,960
you're bad at your job and your brain is

47
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,600
telling you you're bad at your

48
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,119
job then just pay attention to that and

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
try to figure out how to get better the

50
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:03,520
more time you spend working in that

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,119
space of your approximation to the thing

52
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,160
that you want the more time you you

53
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,720
spend becoming an expert in the field of

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,560
this specific application that you're

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,200
making the better you get at that

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,640
subfield of programming and the better

57
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,519
you get at that sub field the better

58
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,040
your decision making about technical

59
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,319
issues in that field is going to be so

60
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
if you make hard decisions

61
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,920
later they will be made better both by a

62
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
more skilled person

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,760
and with more contextual information

64
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
than if you make those hard decisions

65
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,319
early on okay so deferring these kind of

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,800
decisions is actually important for good

67
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,599
craftsmanship in some cases it sounds

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,840
paradoxical because you would think good

69
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,560
craftsmanship is just you see a problem

70
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,480
and you like relentlessly solve it

71
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,239
whenever you see one but I don't find it

72
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,000
to work that way for new programmers

73
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
what would I broadly say about choosing

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,400
a career path in programming the same

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,920
thing I I always say which is be careful

76
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,760
what you choose especially when you're

77
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,879
very young because when you're

78
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,400
young it's the time when you're really

79
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
learning and the time when you're still

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,519
defining yourself I mean you're always

81
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,879
still defining yourself but when you're

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,959
young you're especially doing that

83
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,599
because you have less history behind you

84
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,680
and so if you go somewhere

85
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,280
mediocre and you learn from people who

86
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,599
are doing mediocre

87
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,840
work you're going to be defining

88
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,400
yourself as someone who doesn't do

89
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,519
things that are particular L good or

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,360
particularly special that's just reality

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,319
people don't like it when I say that

92
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,840
that way but that just is what it is

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,840
that's what

94
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,920
happens um if you're lucky you can break

95
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,560
yourself out of that later but better

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,080
never to be in that

97
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,239
situation

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,480
so choose where you work and who you

99
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,000
work with very carefully because there

100
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,239
hasn't been selection pressure on

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
programming culture whether or not you

102
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,480
believe me about whether the current

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,159
culture is right or not you could at

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,439
least expect that there's not that much

105
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:10,360
reason for it to be right there's like a

106
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,560
very mild constraint that your program

107
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,519
does kind of have to run and that's a

108
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,519
reality check but that's getting looser

109
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,440
all the time anyway like look at how

110
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,799
many more and more programmers are hired

111
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,799
just to make a simple program run now

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,880
right like people people spend years at

113
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,400
web companies working on individual web

114
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,160
pages that are about the complexity of

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,240
something I would program in basic when

116
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,759
I was in high school in like a couple

117
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,639
weeks or a week or something right it's

118
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,440
just crazy at this point I think it's

119
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,759
still possible to Pivot later on in life

120
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,280
to try and pursue what you feel is your

121
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,479
true passion while taking more

122
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,120
financially stable choice in the present

123
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,479
no I think people tell themselves all

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,880
the time they're going to do that and

125
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,680
then they just age into their

126
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,560
financially stable

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,560
Choice that's just what happens

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,560
um I

129
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,320
think I think either you're willing to

130
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,199
take risks or you're

131
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:17,240
not and your propensity for taking risks

132
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,680
will only be reduced as you age you'll

133
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,560
never you know it's not like you get 10

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
years older and feel like way more

135
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,280
radical than you did when you were 23

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,400
that's not how that works

137
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,680
okay when you're 43 you'll have way way

138
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,560
more reasons to be conservative than

139
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,840
when you were 23 so if you don't learn

140
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,360
to take risks now you will not do it

141
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,600
later if you have

142
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:47,319
money of any magnitude and you have a

143
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,680
theory about how to do something

144
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:52,720
productive then you should invest that

145
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,720
money in your own

146
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,520
Theory because I mean if you believe it

147
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,199
has a good chance of being right because

148
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,600
you're most in control of that and there

149
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,720
are fewest middlemen skimming off of

150
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,800
that right so the highest return comes

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,759
from you investing that money in your

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,160
own idea um so all these things like

153
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,759
putting it in an index fund or you know

154
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,240
a mutual fund or whatever or bonds

155
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:25,800
that's all for if you don't have an

156
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,280
idea of how to make any money which is

157
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,199
fine for people who don't want to have

158
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,919
an idea or don't want to take any risks

159
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,840
but

160
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,680
if you

161
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,000
do there are better things to do the

162
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,440
people who

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,960
succeed do stuff that nobody else was

164
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,639
doing because the other people talk

165
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,160
themselves out of doing the thing right

166
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,520
that's the secret that you have to know

167
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,120
everybody is talking themselves out of

168
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,720
success all the time and I'm not trying

169
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,000
to sound too self-help gury about that

170
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,840
because self-help people give me the

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,960
creepies but it's true people talk

172
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,160
themselves out of success every day

173
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,000
um it's weird like why would human

174
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,280
beings do that but they do it once you

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,879
learn to see it you see it all the time

176
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,919
all right but you need to stand out from

177
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,680
other people in order to really succeed

178
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,639
at a lot of things and people are afraid

179
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,919
of standing out from other people

180
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:20,280
because when you stand out from the herd

181
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:27,080
you get taken down by a mountain lion or

182
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:29,000
whatever right um so people have strong

183
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,440
resistance to that certain people other

184
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,400
people don't right um people with high

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,000
risk

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,639
tolerance don't have those aversions to

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,280
the same degree and so

188
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,759
um you might be doing that I don't know

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,159
I don't know you um I don't know what

190
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,639
your personality is like but you might

191
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:48,000
be doing that you might be just looking

192
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,680
for

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,479
ways to not succeed while thinking that

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,479
you tried your

195
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:01,039
hardest that is definitely a thing that

196
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
people do

197
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
for me there's not that much question

198
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,560
that I'm going to finish the things that

199
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,319
I do because I've learned the secret of

200
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,720
that uh and the secret of that is you

201
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,599
just do the stuff that you say you're

202
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,639
going to

203
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:20,080
do it's really not hard but most people

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,960
don't do it right okay this is the sad

205
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,080
fact right most people are bad at

206
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,560
programming most people who are good at

207
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,639
programming are really

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,919
busy they're not usually the people

209
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,320
giving you advice about how to

210
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,760
program by sturgeon's

211
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,000
law almost all advice you will see on

212
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:45,399
the internet about how to program is bad

213
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,320
so I mean if you have absolutely no idea

214
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:49,320
how to

215
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,880
program then I guess you go on the

216
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,320
internet and you look for a little bit

217
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,440
like enough to get traction but if you

218
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,000
know how to program a little

219
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,600
bit you probably know better than the

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,200
average advice on the internet all right

221
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,600
so what you need to then do is get

222
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,720
better so that you have enough judgment

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,959
capability to sift the good advice apart

224
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,440
from the bad advice and the only way to

225
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:13,320
do that is to

226
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,680
program how do you level up as a

227
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
programmer who's been primarily working

228
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,720
with web framework stop doing web

229
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,880
programming web programming is bad it

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
will make you a bad programmer stop it

231
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,640
work on other things in other domains

232
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
that is Step number

233
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
one it's like saying how do I become a

234
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,519
better

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,320
athlete when what I do is I sit around

236
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,480
with all the guys on the couch with the

237
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,240
bags of Cheetos and we practice throwing

238
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,519
the Cheetos into each other's

239
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,959
Bowl which is kind of like playing

240
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,959
basketball and it's like no
