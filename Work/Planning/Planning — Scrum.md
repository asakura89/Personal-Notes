## Scrum and Agile

Scrum is Agile because of it is delivered to the customer in small regular increments. The feedback will go to the Product Owner then <ins>create of priorities list of features</ins> and user stories <ins>called Product Backlog</ins>.

Scrum team works in a series of Sprints. Commonly in two weeks. Each Sprint started by Sprint Planning attended by Scrum Master, Development Team, and Product Owner. They select <ins>high priorities item that can be delivered by Development Team by single Sprint called Sprint Backlog</ins>.

Each day there is daily Scrum Meeting. What they did yesterday, what they want to do today, and whether they have any blocker.

Sprint ends with <ins>Sprint Review which is a demo of finished function to stakeholders</ins> and a <ins>Sprint Retrospective which examines what went well, what did not, and what could be improved</ins> from the process.

Regular retrospectives can help the team reflect on the past sprint and identify areas for improvement. This can often lead to uncovering the root cause of issues.
