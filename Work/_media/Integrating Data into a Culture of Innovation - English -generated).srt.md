[Music]

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:18,539
if I think about the scale of the

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,080
services that Netflix delivers I think

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,779
about the role that the culture plays in

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,720
the degree that you're innovating using

7
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,539
open source Technologies tell me a

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,780
little bit about the culture and how

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,219
that plays out so much of Netflix's

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,920
culture was shaped 20 plus years ago by

11
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,399
Reed Hastings who certainly is legendary

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,520
both as founder and until recently

13
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,579
co-ceo of Netflix but also just as an

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,559
amazing leader and disrupter and I think

15
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,860
that that embedded in the Netflix

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:01:00,300
culture from early days we don't want to

17
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,760
be fearful of placing big bets we want

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,440
to be constantly pushing ourselves to be

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,140
more Innovative and certainly more

20
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,840
excellent over time and we want to use

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,000
data and analytical thinking to really

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,600
try to make the best decisions we can

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,299
and that in some ways Netflix culture

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,460
kind of embodies the set of values that

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,040
Reid brought to Netflix in really early

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,619
days and amazingly we've sustained a lot

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,780
of that culture which means that unlike

28
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,180
some other companies I've worked at you

29
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,460
don't really need to fight and kind of

30
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,840
have sharp elbows to say I think we

31
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,119
should look at some of the data and

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,220
insights before we make a decision in

33
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,140
most rooms it's the first question that

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,820
someone would ask of what do we know

35
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,799
about this that's going to help us make

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,140
a better decision if we're going to

37
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,079
place a big Innovative bet in some way

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,460
what gives us some confidence that it's

39
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,939
going to go in a Direction that's

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,040
positive for us but balancing that with

41
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,840
data not always being enough and we need

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,000
some judgment we don't always have the

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,000
perfect data to answer every question

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,979
you can't predict which title is going

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,719
to be a hit as much as we wish we could

46
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,819
there are things that are just always

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,400
imperfect about it and so the Netflix

48
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,459
culture also expects a lot of judgment

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,680
and we expect that at every level of the

50
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,180
organization so there's kind of catch

51
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,420
phrases that show up in our public

52
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,360
culture memo that that sort of embody

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,400
those values so things like freedom and

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,220
responsibility in how you think about

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,860
your accountability for the outcomes and

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,099
the great degree of autonomy or

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,680
Independence you have in decision making

58
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:40,200
also things like context not control so

59
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,120
leaders should not be micromanaging we

60
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,980
should actually be expecting our teams

61
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,080
to bring great ideas to the table

62
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,120
they're often very close to the context

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,220
so they're able to say I think this is a

64
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,319
bet we should make or I think we should

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,379
think about this way to innovate or

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,940
question the status quo in some ways and

67
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,940
then we also have a cultural value

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,340
around closely aligned Loosely coupled

69
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,260
which means we want to all feel like we

70
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,360
understand what we're trying to achieve

71
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,519
and what our end goals are really that's

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
about the member experience and how we

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,400
can continue to improve that and be

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,140
grounded enough in what our strategy is

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,120
that independent groups can make

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,040
decisions without needing to feel like

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,260
we need consensus driven decision making

78
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,819
it really slows you down it means some

79
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,560
groups are less willing to take some

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,420
risk because you might have to jump

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,060
through a lot of Hoops to get approvals

82
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:34,739
and we've really tried to avoid those

83
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,659
things and have process and ways to

84
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,640
evaluate the quality of decision making

85
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:40,620
where it makes sense which I think is

86
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,840
very important that it's not everywhere

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,280
in a way that kind of limits our

88
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,280
velocity and learning and

89
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,040
experimentation and Innovation so it's

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,019
all so closely kind of interwoven in the

91
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,700
way we think about the culture and the

92
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,480
way data and Innovation shows up

93
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,480
throughout the company
