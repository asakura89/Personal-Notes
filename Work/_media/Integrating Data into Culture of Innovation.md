# Integrating Data into Culture of Innovation

## Version \#1

When I think about the scale of the services that Netflix delivers, I also consider the role that the culture plays in the degree that we're innovating using open source technologies. So much of Netflix's culture was shaped 20 plus years ago by Reed Hastings, who is certainly legendary both as founder and until recently co-CEO of Netflix, but also just as an amazing leader and disrupter.

I think that this is embedded in the Netflix culture from early days. We don't want to be fearful of placing big bets. We want to be constantly pushing ourselves to be more innovative and certainly more excellent over time. We want to use data and analytical thinking to really try to make the best decisions we can. In some ways, Netflix culture kind of embodies the set of values that Reid brought to Netflix in really early days and amazingly, we've sustained a lot of that culture.

This means that unlike some other companies I've worked at, you don't really need to fight and kind of have sharp elbows to say, "I think we should look at some of the data and insights before we make a decision." In most rooms, it's the first question that someone would ask: "What do we know about this that's going to help us make a better decision?" If we're going to place a big innovative bet in some way, what gives us some confidence that it's going to go in a direction that's positive for us?

But balancing that with data not always being enough and we need some judgment. We don't always have the perfect data to answer every question. You can't predict which title is going to be a hit as much as we wish we could. There are things that are just always imperfect about it and so the Netflix culture also expects a lot of judgment and we expect that at every level of the organization.

So there's kind of catch phrases that show up in our public culture memo that sort of embody those values. Things like freedom and responsibility in how you think about your accountability for the outcomes and the great degree of autonomy or independence you have in decision making. Also things like context not control, so leaders should not be micromanaging. We should actually be expecting our teams to bring great ideas to the table. They're often very close to the context so they're able to say, "I think this is a bet we should make," or "I think we should think about this way to innovate," or question the status quo in some ways.

Then we also have a cultural value around closely aligned, loosely coupled, which means we want to all feel like we understand what we're trying to achieve and what our end goals are. Really, that's about the member experience and how we can continue to improve that and be grounded enough in what our strategy is that independent groups can make decisions without needing to feel like we need consensus driven decision making. It really slows you down. It means some groups are less willing to take some risk because you might have to jump through a lot of hoops to get approvals.

We've really tried to avoid those things and have process and ways to evaluate the quality of decision making where it makes sense, which I think is very important that it's not everywhere in a way that kind of limits our velocity and learning and experimentation and innovation. So it's all so closely kind of interwoven in the way we think about the culture and the way data and innovation shows up throughout the company.



## Version \#1.1

### Netflix's Culture and Innovation

When we talk about the vast services that Netflix offers, we also need to think about the role of its culture in our continuous innovation using open source technologies. Netflix's culture was largely shaped over 20 years ago by Reed Hastings, who is not only the founder and until recently co-CEO of Netflix, but also a remarkable leader and innovator.

This culture has been a part of Netflix since the early days. We are not afraid to take big risks. We always strive to be more innovative and improve over time. We use data and analytical thinking to make the best decisions possible. In many ways, Netflix's culture embodies the values that Reid brought to Netflix in the early days, and amazingly, we've managed to maintain much of that culture.



### Data-Driven Decision Making

Unlike some other companies, at Netflix, you don't need to argue to say, "We should look at some data and insights before we make a decision." In most discussions, the first question someone would ask is: "What do we know about this that can help us make a better decision?" If we're going to take a big innovative risk, what gives us some confidence that it's going to benefit us?

However, we also understand that data is not always enough and we need to use some judgment. We don't always have the perfect data to answer every question. You can't predict which title is going to be a hit as much as we wish we could. There are always uncertainties, and so the Netflix culture also expects a lot of judgment and we expect that at every level of the organization.



### Cultural Values

Our public culture memo includes catch phrases that embody these values. Things like freedom and responsibility in how you think about your accountability for the outcomes and the great degree of autonomy or independence you have in decision making. Also things like context not control, so leaders should not be micromanaging. We should actually be expecting our teams to bring great ideas to the table. They're often very close to the context so they're able to say, "I think this is a bet we should make," or "I think we should think about this way to innovate," or question the status quo in some ways.

We also have a cultural value around closely aligned, loosely coupled, which means we want to all feel like we understand what we're trying to achieve and what our end goals are. Really, that's about the member experience and how we can continue to improve that and be grounded enough in what our strategy is that independent groups can make decisions without needing to feel like we need consensus driven decision making. It really slows you down. It means some groups are less willing to take some risk because you might have to jump through a lot of hoops to get approvals.

We've really tried to avoid those things and have process and ways to evaluate the quality of decision making where it makes sense, which I think is very important that it's not everywhere in a way that kind of limits our velocity and learning and experimentation and innovation. So it's all so closely kind of interwoven in the way we think about the culture and the way data and innovation shows up throughout the company.



## Version \#2

If I think about the scale of the services that Netflix delivers, I think about the role that the culture plays in the degree that you're innovating using open source technologies.

So, tell me a little bit about the culture and how that plays out.

So much of Netflix's culture was shaped 20 plus years ago by Reed Hastings, who certainly is legendary both as founder and until recently co-CEO of Netflix, but also just as an amazing leader and disrupter.

And I think that that embedded in the Netflix culture from early days: we don't want to be fearful of placing big bets, we want to be constantly pushing ourselves to be more innovative and certainly more excellent over time, and we want to use data and analytical thinking to really try to make the best decisions we can.

And that in some ways, Netflix culture kind of embodies the set of values that Reed brought to Netflix in really early days, and amazingly we've sustained a lot of that culture.

Which means that unlike some other companies I've worked at, you don't really need to fight and kind of have sharp elbows to say "I think we should look at some of the data and insights before we make a decision."

In most rooms, it's the first question that someone would ask: "What do we know about this that's going to help us make a better decision? If we're going to place a big innovative bet in some way, what gives us some confidence that it's going to go in a direction that's positive for us?"

So there's kind of catch phrases that show up in our public culture memo that that sort of embody those values, so things like freedom and responsibility in how you think about your accountability for the outcomes and the great degree of autonomy or independence you have in decision-making.

Also things like context, not control, so leaders should not be micromanaging, we should actually be expecting our teams to bring great ideas to the table.

## Version \#2.1

### The Interplay of Culture, Data, and Innovation at Netflix

**Building a Culture of Bold Innovation**
or **Building a Culture of Bold Bets and Informed Decisions**

Netflix's success in delivering massive streaming services is deeply connected to its company culture, which heavily emphasizes innovation using open-source technologies. This culture was shaped in the early days by Reed Hastings, the co-founder and legendary leader of Netflix. Hastings wasn't just a successful businessman; he was a disruptor who instilled a set of core values in the company. 

A core principle at Netflix is the willingness to take big risks. The company constantly pushes itself to be more innovative and improve its services over time. Data and analytical thinking are crucial for making the best decisions possible. In essence, Netflix culture reflects the values that Hastings brought to the company in its early days, and remarkably, the company has managed to sustain this culture for a long time.

**Data-Driven Decisions with a Human Touch**

Unlike some companies, Netflix doesn't have a culture of competition or needing to fight for your ideas. Data analysis is highly valued, and it's common practice to ask "What do we know about this?" before making a decision.  This data helps guide innovative bets and increases confidence in their success.

However, Netflix recognizes that data isn't always the answer. Predicting which shows will be hits is an imperfect science.  There's always an element of human judgment involved.  The company culture expects employees at all levels to exercise good judgment, even when perfect data isn't available.

**Empowering Teams with Freedom and Responsibility**
or **Catchphrases that Capture the Culture**

Netflix's public culture document reflects these values with catchy phrases.  "Freedom and responsibility" emphasizes accountability for outcomes while granting employees a high degree of autonomy in decision-making.  Another key concept is "context, not control." Leaders are expected to empower teams, not micromanage them.  Teams closest to the situation are encouraged to bring ideas to the table, challenge the status quo, and propose innovative solutions.

**Alignment and Autonomy: Working Together, Independently**

Another core value is "closely aligned, loosely coupled."  This means everyone at Netflix understands the overall goals, particularly how their work contributes to improving the member experience.  However, independent teams can make decisions without needing total consensus. This avoids the slowdowns and risk-aversion that can come with needing approval from everyone. 

Netflix avoids unnecessary processes and focuses on evaluating the quality of decision-making when it truly matters. This approach ensures that the company maintains its speed, ability to learn, and capacity to experiment and innovate.  In conclusion, culture, data, and innovation are all tightly interwoven at Netflix. The company's culture fosters a data-driven approach while valuing human judgment and empowering teams to make independent decisions that drive innovation.
