00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,509
hey coach Kevin here today I want to

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,759
talk to you about something I found

3
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:10,570
that's very very interesting from Jeff

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,490
Bezos the the CEO by Amazon and it's

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,349
called day one thinking first of all I

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,299
want to give a thank you to Todd Roberts

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,160
at TFS he's the one that brought this

8
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:20,560
article to light for me and I've used it

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,150
a lot ever since so the essence of day

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,130
one thinking is something that Jeff

11
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,910
Bezos wrote in his shareholder letter in

12
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:30,310
2017 and it's basically how they or he

13
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,200
thinks about keeping Amazon fresh the

14
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,329
short version of the story is he

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,000
initially had a building he worked in

16
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:38,739
called day one and and now in his new

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,910
location he moved he took the name of

18
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:41,980
the building with him which i think is

19
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,920
kind of interesting but the basic

20
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,829
essence is it's that day one fight and

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,020
fire and determination you have to do

22
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:51,789
all of the best things for your clients

23
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,579
that keeps you strong in the beginning

24
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:56,699
but often fades away over time and

25
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:59,680
weakens your business and makes you more

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,600
self oriented versus customer oriented

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,340
which often can really end up hurting

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,110
you so you can see the letter on the

29
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,760
screen and you can look it up online to

30
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,500
read the full letter but what I want to

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,630
share with you is really four main

32
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,460
points he makes in this letter and this

33
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,930
makes a great self-assessment and

34
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,390
discussion for you and your team when

35
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:18,910
you're doing annex planning session

36
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,700
day two is stasis followed by

37
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,860
irrelevance followed by excruciatingly

38
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,950
painful decline followed by death and

39
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,900
that's why it's always day one to be

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:32,320
sure this kind of decline would happen

41
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:34,120
in extreme slow motion an established

42
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,640
company might harvest day two for

43
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,130
decades but the final result would still

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,170
come I'm interested in the question how

45
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,390
do you fend off day two what are the

46
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,000
techniques and tactics how do you keep

47
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,940
the vitality of day one inside a large

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,920
organization such a question can't have

49
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,979
a simple answer there may be many

50
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,470
elements multiple paths many traps I

51
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,020
don't know the whole answer but I may

52
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,330
know bits of it here's a starter pack of

53
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,610
essentials for day one defense and he

54
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,290
gets into these four points and measures

55
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,960
which you can read about in more detail

56
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:10,300
number one is customer obsession and

57
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,920
it's about being obsessed with pleasing

58
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,910
the customer and knowing that they're

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,830
always happily dissatisfied meaning

60
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,080
there's more things that they would like

61
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,790
or they would enjoy but they don't even

62
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,769
know yet so there's always huge

63
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,080
opportunities to please them and if you

64
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,090
watch Amazon they continually release

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,970
new products and services that make you

66
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:33,070
thrilled if you're an Amazon customer so

67
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:37,030
the question for your team is on a scale

68
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,459
of zero to ten how would we rate a true

69
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,650
customer obsession compared to this day

70
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,600
one thinking the second one is outcome

71
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,580
orientation and what business talks

72
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,489
about in this is that many companies as

73
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,370
they grow become process orientated I

74
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:54,040
eat were doing the work we're doing the

75
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,830
project we're revising the policy we're

76
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,690
implementing the system but they forget

77
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,820
to measure did we get the dollars and

78
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,130
cents out of it or the results we

79
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,690
actually required when you're a startup

80
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,580
it's easy because you have no cash and

81
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,680
everything has to work but when you get

82
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,540
bigger and have more resources people

83
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,580
often start to focus on doing their work

84
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,860
versus getting the result and I see this

85
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:17,049
in companies all the time where people

86
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,940
are doing good work but because the

87
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:20,170
finish line is not clear enough they

88
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,940
sometimes don't get there when they

89
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,320
could step three is early adoption of

90
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,270
trends and for those of you that know me

91
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,980
know I love trends and seeing what's

92
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,110
coming next that's part of feeding our

93
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,590
strategic brands but in this what he

94
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,379
talks

95
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,540
is not resisting change and eagerly

96
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,580
trying out new things you don't need to

97
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,769
be the first you don't need to be on the

98
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,080
bleeding edge of innovation but you need

99
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,319
to do enough to continually adopt them

100
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,209
and embrace them and be part of them for

101
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,250
high-velocity decision-making and he

102
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,110
talks about how as companies get bigger

103
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,790
and there's more stakeholders it's easy

104
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,410
to get lost in debates who are trying to

105
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,480
make the right decision or the perfect

106
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,629
decision this fits into a Jim Collins

107
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,370
calls bullets versus cannonballs let's

108
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:02,769
do bullets and test and keep moving

109
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,510
versus waiting for the one big move or

110
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,579
moving too quickly on the one big move

111
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,450
but he looked at organizations in his

112
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,880
organization's

113
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,450
how quickly are we making the important

114
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,670
decisions in and another article by Jeff

115
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,579
what he talks about is a type A and type

116
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:20,290
B decision one of them is like a two-way

117
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:22,450
door you can make the decision and you

118
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,669
can back out of it and with that you

119
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,430
should decide very quickly because it's

120
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,039
easy to reverse type B is like a one-way

121
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,930
door you're signing a massive contract

122
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:34,510
for ten years or making a big long-term

123
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,789
commitment and that needs rigorous

124
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,860
debate more information but what a lot

125
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:41,260
of companies do is they will use type B

126
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,300
decisions hearty decision process for a

127
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,370
simple one or they'll use late decision

128
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,990
making for a hardy one and that

129
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,400
obviously becomes a problem so the key

130
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,650
is are we making our decisions very

131
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,120
quickly so we could move and take care

132
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,590
of the customer so what I would

133
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,990
challenge you to do is with your team

134
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,419
take these four questions and rate

135
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,099
yourself and then say of those four

136
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:01,360
which one would you benefit the most

137
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:04,180
from improving on

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,520
so in summary day one thinking keeps us

139
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,200
fresh keeps us vibrant keeps us taking

140
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,550
care of our customers and actually makes

141
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,490
it a more enjoyable place to work

142
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,139
because stuff happens day two is easy to

143
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,840
fall into because we get comfortable and

144
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,000
that is extremely risky never mind the

145
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,470
fact that it's not rewarding have a

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,470
great week see you soon
