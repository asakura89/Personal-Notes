1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:08,750
We can't really have any of the other aspects
of the culture, including candor, learning,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,219
seeking excellence in improvement, freedom
and responsibility if you don't start with

3
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:14,430
high talent density.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:20,620
And in some ways, it's very reflective of
Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:27,939
So when he founded Netflix and grew the company
over time, it was with a belief that there

6
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:33,879
could be a different approach to building
a company that would make it a place that

7
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,719
people thrived in and loved being and would
feel different than other places, both in

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,620
the quality of that talent density, but even
more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes.

9
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,710
And that that's where people would derive
a lot of sense of fulfillment.

10
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,430
So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from
its original days.

11
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,730
And in order to do that, you have to really
hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:06,440
feel like natural human behavior.

13
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,820
Today my guest is Elizabeth Stone.

14
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,090
Elizabeth is chief technology officer at Netflix,
and as far as I can tell, the first economist

15
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,640
to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,700
Prior to this role, Elizabeth was vice president
of Data and Insights.

17
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,610
Before Netflix, she was vice president of
science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at

18
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,380
Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst
Group.

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,210
In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground.

20
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,159
We talk about how an economics background
has helped Elizabeth in her career and why

21
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,330
she expects to see more economists rise in
the ranks of tech companies.

22
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,540
She shares some of her secret sauce for rising
so quickly at so many companies so consistently.

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:52,560
We delve into Netflix's very unique culture
of high talent density, radical candor, and

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,909
freedom and responsibility.

25
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,119
We also talk about the structure that Netflix
has for their data and user research teams,

26
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,850
which she believes is a part of Netflix's
secret to success.

27
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,390
We also get into what biking and triathlons
have taught Elizabeth about life and how she

28
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,250
brings that into her work and so much more.

29
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,980
A huge thank you to Ali Rao for introducing

Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here
and welcome to the podcast.

65
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,530
Thank you.

66
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,070
Thank you for having me.

67
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,530
So when we booked this conversation, you are
VP of data in Netflix.

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,500
And since then you got a promotion, you're
now the CTO of Netflix, which feels significantly

69
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,320
more fancy.

70
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,800
Question for you, what is life like now that
you are CTO versus VP of data?

71
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,110
How is it most different?

72
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,700
I'm imagining more meetings.

73
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:08,310
I would say the biggest thing that changed
is probably the amount of context switching

74
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,820
and the degree to which I feel behind or I
have a lot to learn.

75
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:20,500
And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the
VP of data and insights role that I was in

76
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,610
before in part because we cover a lot of different
areas of the business and there's always people

77
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,810
to learn from, but the engineering organization
just takes that to 100 basically.

78
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,750
So more people to get to know, more problem
spaces, aspects of technical expertise that

79
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,160
I'm just not as deeply familiar with.

80
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,669
And yeah, a lot more meetings.

81
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:43,900
I imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.

82
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
Yes.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,020
So thankfully not a lot of meetings that Netflix
feel like now you're really in this scary

84
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:56,470
room, but it does feel like the role has more
consequence, which is actually an exciting

85
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,470
thing.

86
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,290
Kind along the lines of what you just talked
about being a CTO.

87
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,830
Your background is actually unusual.

88
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,280
You're a trained economist, you got a PhD
in economics.

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,639
And from what I can tell, you're the first
CTO of Fortune 500 company that is an economist

90
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,370
trained in economics.

91
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,370
First of all, is that true?

92
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,930
I don't know if I think that's true, but you
tell me.

93
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,319
I have not checked the list.

94
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,300
That was one of the things I did not do after
getting the title.

95
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,190
It might be unusual.

96
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,711
I've heard a lot of feedback on that, so I
don't know if I'm the one and only, but I

97
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,910
will definitely say it's probably unusual.

98
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,910
Yeah.

99
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,590
So I guess the question is just, do you think
this is an anomaly and going to continue to

100
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,590
be really rare?

101
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,380
Do you think this some are going to see more
at tech companies?

102
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,770
And generally do you think tech companies
should hire more economists?

103
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,970
Yes to the last question.

104
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,530
That's the easiest of it.

105
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,639
But one of the things I observed even with
the focus on data science where I've been

106
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,810
deeper for a period of time is that economics
is a flavor of data science.

107
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,730
So it is a set of technical skills for sure.

108
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,039
It's a way of framing certain problems or
solving challenges.

109
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:13,069
And so when I was first switching from economics
into tech, it was before there was a lot of

110
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,789
sort of the frenzy around data science that
we've seen more recently and it was harder

111
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:24,509
to make that argument that economics is a
flavor of data science and maybe complimentary

112
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,300
to other versions of data science.

113
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,949
And I feel more strongly about that now that
I've seen it up close.

114
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:36,940
And so maybe by extension I would say just
like I think data science can be helpful for

115
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,569
a lot of different problems that you might
not immediately think, "Oh, this is something

116
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:47,630
that we should bring data to," I think that
economics is generally valuable for a lot

117
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,729
of different challenges and it's a useful
perspective to add to things, especially in

118
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:59,199
a business context and especially in how we
want to simplify problems in a way that makes

119
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,840
them feel tractable.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,280
So I feel like that's been a benefit to me
to have had that type of formal training and

121
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,879
then bring that perspective or way of thinking
to different roles.

122
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,440
And so I don't know that many people at Netflix
think of me as an economist, but I find it

123
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
comes out in the way I think about things.

124
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,220
So to the extent that that's true generally,
I think it's useful in a lot of companies.

125
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,169
And I feel like even since I made the switch
towards tech, I've seen it become much, much

126
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,830
more common to think about the value of having
economists on teams.

127
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:37,659
Just to pull on that thread a little bit more,
is there something very tactical or concrete

128
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:40,560
that you can share that you find helpful with
that background that you found helpful in

129
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
your career?

130
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,350
Other than the dismal dry science of it all?

131
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:59,890
So one example would probably be in an understanding
incentives and thinking about unintended consequences.

132
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:06,160
I think that that is true both in terms of
internal leadership, so being part of a management

133
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,200
team that's thinking about how do we clarify
priorities or motivate a company or define

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,690
the problems we want to solve.

135
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,600
And then part of it is more externally oriented.

136
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,100
How do we want to think about what Netflix
is to consumers and how we want to think about

137
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,940
competition?

138
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,760
There can be a rational way of thought, which
is one version of economics of shouldn't rational

139
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:34,050
intelligent people behave in the following
way.

140
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,140
And then there's the, well, if given certain
incentives, what might you see that we didn't

141
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,010
think was optimal or we weren't expecting
to happen but could be a consequence or repercussion

142
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,010
here?

143
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:50,180
And so I think that that type of framing,
I don't know if it's unique to economics in

144
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:58,200
a way because it has elements of psychology
to it as well and planning ahead has become

145
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,660
really useful for thinking through cause and
effect.

146
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,800
So that has come up in a lot of different
spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've

147
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
been in.

148
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,120
I was looking at your LinkedIn and looking
at your career over the years.

149
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,160
It seems like you've had a meteoric rise at
four different companies.

150
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,529
And I'll just walk through them briefly.

151
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,350
So at your first job, you went from associate
to vice president in three years.

152
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,130
At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager
of data science to COO in two years.

153
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,840
At Netflix you went from VP to CTO in three
years.

154
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,160
I think that's really rare.

155
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,360
I'm curious what is your secret sauce to being
so successful at so many places and especially

156
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,430
in the context of what advice can you share
with folks earlier in their career?

157
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,930
This is one of those questions that sparks
the reflection that I wouldn't normally do,

158
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,720
so that's great.

159
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
I really don't think of it as a secret sauce,
but maybe I can walk through some of the things

160
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,880
that I think have been instrumental.

161
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,800
As you listed that out, it sounds like the
two to three year point is the real sweet

162
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,240
spot, so maybe there's something about that
timeline.

163
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:19,839
But I think some things almost feel trite
in how I would say them, which is I'm very

164
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,320
dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm
part of.

165
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:31,291
It's been part who I am for a long time that
I give everything I've got to the job that

166
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,291
I'm in.

167
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:38,060
And I think that dedication and that I get
joy out of that has mattered.

168
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,170
It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing.

169
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:46,430
I do the best work I possibly can, less so
for myself and my own ambition and more so

170
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,980
because I think of myself as being part of
a team and so I really need to deliver for

171
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,710
that team.

172
00:11:52,710 --> 00:12:02,160
I think that framing in my mind and that motivation
has helped me in a few fronts, which is the

173
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,110
way in which I build partnerships with people
I work with that I really care about setting

174
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:13,490
other people up for success and being someone
that people want to work with, so I learn

175
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:18,620
from them, they learn from me, and we get
better outcomes for the business together,

176
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,790
I have found that part of that is being someone
that people can leverage to translate from

177
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,800
technical to non-technical and non-technical
to technical.

178
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,500
So that I do think has been a relative advantage
in my role.

179
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:41,040
So while I was often sitting in more technically-oriented
teams, a lot of the advancement in my career

180
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,320
was to roles that required that type of communication
fluency.

181
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,380
It grew out of being able to partner with
people across the businesses who didn't necessarily

182
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,790
have the same background, but where we needed
to really connect spaces so that we could

183
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,380
be more effective.

184
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,790
That was something that I think really the
training for that came from analysis group

185
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:08,130
where it was a very quantitative set of work
that we had to find a way to communicate to

186
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,990
judges and juries for economic cases.

187
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,690
So that was something that was trained in
other roles and I think I've been able to

188
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,690
leverage.

189
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:25,450
I'm a relatively introverted only child, so
I observe a lot, which means that I learned

190
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,440
from other people.

191
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,240
And in each of these roles I have tried really
hard to watch what other people are doing,

192
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,480
think about how could I learn something from
them, whether it's the thing that I want to

193
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,029
be able to do myself or it's the thing that
I think, "Oh, that doesn't quite fit or feel

194
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,540
authentic with my style."

195
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,850
And I do a lot of that introspection.

196
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,769
So I have been surrounded by amazing people
in all these roles and I have a feeling that

197
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:59,050
I learned a lot by osmosis and observation
and then have been able to leverage that to

198
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,110
be stronger in the roles I was sitting in.

199
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,110
I took a few notes here.

200
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,620
A few things you mentioned is just like, dedication,
essentially working really hard and taking

201
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,040
your work seriously, being part of a team
and setting other people up for success, translating

202
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,529
complex tech language and problems to non-tech
people, and then being really good at observing

203
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,570
and learning from other people around you.

204
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,770
Is there an example or two that you could
share of some of these to make it even more

205
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,779
concrete for people?

206
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:25,779
Like dedication.

207
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:28,810
Is that just like working many hours, being
part of a team?

208
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:35,660
Anything along those lines to share a story
maybe to help people put this into practice.

209
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:42,470
No, and it's a good clarification because
the dedication piece really isn't about long

210
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,370
working hours.

211
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:53,910
It's more about how much I care about excellence,
I guess.

212
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,670
So giving it my best in those situations.

213
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,260
And that might not mean that I work really
wild hours or I work weekends or I'm the one

214
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,130
who's willing to sacrifice the vacation.

215
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:10,589
I've actually tried to avoid setting that
as an expectation, but more that I hold myself

216
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,180
to a very high standard.

217
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:22,290
So an example would be, especially as I've
gotten more senior in roles, there can be

218
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:30,550
an expectation that it's okay for other people
to wait on me.

219
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,089
So whether it's the timing for a meeting or
providing input on something or reviewing

220
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:43,000
a document or following through on something
I said that I was going to do, and I really

221
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,520
try to avoid that, which means that if someone
sends me something, I try to be very responsive

222
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,529
about it.

223
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,899
If I know that I said I'm going to do something,
I follow through on it in the timeline that

224
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,660
I said I was going to do.

225
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,140
If I have a meeting, I try to be on time to
that meeting.

226
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,170
Those are all flavors of dedication to the
work that show up in, "Oh, it seems like Elizabeth

227
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:12,220
works really hard," but the motivation factor
is other people are relying on me and I want

228
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,970
to show up for them.

229
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,870
And so that's when I say dedication and it's
related to the second point around showing

230
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:25,060
up well for the team, those would all be examples
of I feel urgency in responding to people

231
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,700
and doing high quality work.

232
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:34,730
For the other parts of technical to non-technical,
I think a great example is actually a very

233
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:43,940
timely one at Netflix, which is, we are making
strides to offer live content types.

234
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,699
So live events, live TV shows.

235
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:52,810
We announced this week that we're going to
be hosting WWE starting later this year and

236
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,769
early next year, 2025.

237
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:58,899
That is easier said than done.

238
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:03,650
I know that there's a lot of entertainment
companies that have live content.

239
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,049
But Netflix has really been in the streaming
content business, so live content is something

240
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:13,910
new for us and it's something that's going
to require a really close partnership between

241
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,470
our content organization and our products
and technology organization because there's

242
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,679
a content strategy to it, there's a business
strategy, there's a technology strategy to

243
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,059
it.

244
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:31,539
A big part of my role is, can I explain how
we're going to approach those technical problems

245
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:35,250
in a way that builds competence with the content
team?

246
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,610
Can I try to understand their content strategy
in a way that sets the technical teams up

247
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:44,679
for success and we understand what we need
to be able to deliver on here in terms of

248
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:46,650
requirements.

249
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,010
I don't think I'd be able to do my current
role well if I wasn't able to do that type

250
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:56,039
of translation for something that's going
to be a big bet for the business and something

251
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,169
we want to invest in jointly.

252
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:01,160
And then to set my partners up for success
in that.

253
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,880
So I am going to do everything I can to make
sure we deliver well for my content partners

254
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,010
because I feel like that's what's best for
Netflix in the business.

255
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,010
Amazing examples.

256
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,890
In terms of life content, I think about the
Love is Blind.

257
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,630
I think it was for premier, whatever, reunion
that we got sucked into that show.

258
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:21,059
So good job.

259
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,919
And I think there were some issues with that,
right?

260
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,000
That reunion streak.

261
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,400
Well, yeah, that was about a little less than
a year ago now.

262
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,370
So the amazing thing about failure is you
learn a lot.

263
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,130
We learned a lot.

264
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,539
We've taken notes on it and we had a couple
successful events after that, including the

265
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:42,580
Netflix Cup last October.

266
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,170
And we've got some exciting events coming
up.

267
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,420
So I think that's something that strengthened
us, but did reveal that we're tackling a hard

268
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,420
problem.

269
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,320
Yeah, the Twitter feeds during that, Love
is Blind premiere were hilarious.

270
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,910
People are pissed.

271
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,910
Okay.

272
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:01,160
And then in terms of the, keeping a high bar
for yourself, I love that.

273
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,180
I think about a quote that...

274
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,940
There's a VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate and
she did this interview with Tim Ferris.

275
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,550
She shared that her dad always asked her,
"Are you doing a World-class job with this?

276
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,560
Are you doing a world-class job with your
homework?

277
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,630
Are you doing a world-class job with your
piano recital?"

278
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,309
And that's the bar that he always had for
her.

279
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:27,020
And I feel like that's a really good way to
think about work and life in general if you

280
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,790
can.

281
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:37,929
Yeah, my mother used to describe to me, probably
still does, though it required more repeating

282
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:46,450
when I was younger, that the last 5% is the
5% that really mattered.

283
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:53,159
And so it is that framing of the extra effort
you put into something to make it world-class

284
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,890
or to make it excellent.

285
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:01,880
And so I do like to push myself that way and
I hope it sets a good example for other people

286
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
too.

287
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,179
It's very consistent with especially the company
cultures that I tend to thrive in where that's

288
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:10,470
the general expectation of the culture.

289
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,620
So you don't feel like you're doing it alone,
because then I think you can start to feel

290
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,770
frustrated by that.

291
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,320
I know that this is a big part of Netflix
culture and I want to get into it.

292
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,300
But before that, I'm curious just what that
looks like with people that report to you.

293
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,100
How do you help them level up in this skill
of having a really high bar?

294
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,429
And an example I'll give as you think about
maybe an example is the way I described this

295
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:38,000
to my PMs was, you want to have this aura
that you've got this that, "If you give Lenny

296
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,160
something, he's got this.

297
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,170
He's going to follow up, he's going to close
the loop, he's going to get it done.

298
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,390
If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I
feel like this thread will not disappear.

299
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:47,470
He won't drop this ball."

300
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,930
Is there anything that you've learned as a
good way to help someone learn this kind of

301
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,419
skill, understand why this is so important?

302
00:20:53,419 --> 00:21:01,049
It shows up for the people who report to me,
is one part example setting.

303
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:04,159
So if I don't do it, why would they do it?

304
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:13,070
I treat that very seriously that we should
all be held to the same standards.

305
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:19,169
And as a second thing, I give feedback when
it's not up to the standard.

306
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:25,720
So I think one of the things I've observed
especially with people on my teams is that

307
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,800
the expectations aren't always clear and you
can't assume that they're clear if you don't

308
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,020
share them.

309
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,900
When something's not meeting expectations
or really showing up as excellence, I think

310
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,270
it's a combination of both giving the feedback
on that and being direct about it and being

311
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:52,390
specific about what would it take to get this
to the bar that I am expecting or to show

312
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,299
up in the way that I'm expecting.

313
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:00,800
And then the third and probably most important
thing is help them fill that gap.

314
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,380
So that would mean...

315
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,789
Let's take an example.

316
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,080
It certainly has happened frequently in many
jobs.

317
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,861
A document is okay, it's not great, it's not
going to be easy for people to follow, it's

318
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,450
not as crisp as it could be.

319
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,919
There's things that would strengthen it.

320
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,929
I can both give the feedback on that to make
sure like, yes, it's going to take another

321
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:25,950
round of iteration, yes, we're going to have
to work another week on this and not be done

322
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:32,270
with it, but pushing people to get there,
and then jumping into the document and helping.

323
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,779
So I feel very strongly about, and that's
kind of what I mean by setting an example

324
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,620
of like, "Let's work on this together," and
then through that, help people uplevel themselves

325
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:47,620
so the next time around they know the expectations
and they've had help getting there in the

326
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,620
past.

327
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,669
So that's probably happened a thousand times
in my career where I jump in with both feet

328
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,400
because something needs to be better and I
think the teams are better for it afterwards,

329
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,840
or I hope they are.

330
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,650
I think that's such a good framework just
to kind of mirror back what you said, "Set

331
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,360
expectations that the bar is going to be really
high and here's what I'm expecting from you."

332
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,090
Give them very specific feedback on where
the gap is and then help them fill that gap.

333
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,799
I think a lot of people may feel this and
hear this and they're like, "Oh man, I don't

334
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,620
want a manager that's like this high of an
expectation person and it just feels really

335
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,620
stressful."

336
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,559
But I've had these managers and I feel like
that's when I've learned the most and leveled

337
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,300
up the most, is having someone that had really
high expectations and then helped me understand,

338
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,520
"Here's where you're not doing as well as
you can.

339
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,080
I know you can do better.

340
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,470
Go back and work on this."

341
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,940
I know that sounds annoying, but I think in
practice it ends up helping you most in your

342
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
career.

343
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:45,440
I imagine you've seen a similar result.

344
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
I think so.

345
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,440
I mean you'd have to ask some of the people
on my team.

346
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,030
So I might look at it differently that they
look at it.

347
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,030
[inaudible 00:23:52] differences.

348
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,320
It's a hard skill because it's not always
easy to give feedback, especially if you feel

349
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,090
like you know someone's put a lot of effort
into something.

350
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:06,720
And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver
that feedback so it feels like we're on the

351
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,659
same team and I'm trying to help them be successful,
not to help encourage failure.

352
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:19,000
And that's where I think that third piece
of the framework of jumping in to help can

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,370
make people feel like, "I'm in a safe space.

354
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,070
My manager wants me to be successful.

355
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,570
My manager's helping me here."

356
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,950
I do often do that behind the scenes.

357
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:35,899
So maybe that's another flavor of this, which
is, I don't do it live in the big meeting

358
00:24:35,899 --> 00:24:40,440
in front of all the people where the presentation
doesn't go very well.

359
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,720
I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer
space to say, "Here's a way this could have

360
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,800
gone better.

361
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,320
Let's think about this differently next time."

362
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,520
So it gives people a little grace and a little
bit of an ability to absorb that feedback

363
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,550
without feeling like it's kind of on a stage.

364
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,169
Another thing someone may be feeling when
they're hearing this is like, "Oh my god,

365
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:10,289
it's going to take me so many hours to just
get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with."

366
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:13,030
And I know you said that this doesn't mean
necessarily many hours.

367
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:17,890
Do you have any advice or thoughts on just
how to avoid burnout and working all the time,

368
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,830
but also keeping this really high bar and
high expectations?

369
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,400
It truly is not about time.

370
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,140
I even found myself in a meeting earlier today
saying, "If we're clear on the objectives

371
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:39,170
of something, it might be that the last 20%
of polish on the document is a really bad

372
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:41,140
use of time.

373
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,890
So if we're going to come together to talk
through..."

374
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:47,980
Like quarterly business review was the example,
what were the highlights?

375
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,240
What were the low lights?

376
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,720
What were the learnings from the quarter?

377
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,429
Where are there places of misalignment?

378
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:58,680
The reason we're doing the quarterly business
review is to have a really candid conversation

379
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:03,679
about how we think things are going, to have
a debate about things where maybe we're stuck.

380
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,210
It's not to have a perfectly polished document
for that conversation.

381
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,540
So my feedback in that instance would be,
I would much rather have someone spend the

382
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:15,640
time thinking about what's the conversation
we really want to have?

383
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,140
"How do I tee that up?"

384
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,799
Not, "Could I spend another 20 hours to make
it look like everything's perfect in this

385
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:23,799
document?"

386
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:28,820
And so I think in that sense it's not just
excellence, like you wrote the perfect document,

387
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,090
I should probably be careful to not use that
as the only example, but instead we really

388
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,539
got to the outcome we wanted to get to because
we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot

389
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:43,080
of energy and time and iteration into making
sure we got to that outcome.

390
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,090
And is this an example where you gave someone
feedback that they spent too much time on

391
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:49,220
the polish or is this earlier?

392
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,790
And to give the pyramid of this framework
you kind of shared of set expectations, give

393
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,841
specific feedback, help them fill the gap
and then do it in private, is this the expectation

394
00:26:56,841 --> 00:27:00,870
setting in this example or is this feedback
you spend too much time on this?

395
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,399
This is expectation setting.

396
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:07,640
So one of the things in my new role is that
there's some practices that the team has had

397
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,010
where they're trying to understand, Are we
still going to have those practices?

398
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,660
What's going to be the same versus different
about those things?"

399
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,870
and get an understanding of my expectations.

400
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,730
So it's great that people ask that question
so that I can be clear about, "Oh wait, if

401
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,790
you're on the last 20% of this polishing the
dock, I'd rather spend time over here.

402
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,159
And here's how I would like the conversation
to go so we all get something out of it instead

403
00:27:33,159 --> 00:27:38,140
of it feeling like it's just a leadership
reviewer on my behalf."

404
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,880
So in this specific situation, it was setting
expectations ahead of time so that we can

405
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,280
set everyone up for success.

406
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Awesome.

407
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,280
Okay.

408
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,059
So we've kind of been talking around this,
but this is an important part of the Netflix

409
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,059
culture.

410
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:54,720
Just broadly, Netflix has a really special
and unique culture.

411
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,420
Even though it's been around for I think over
25 years now, it feels like the culture has

412
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,659
come up many times.

413
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:02,809
There's that initial culture deck that came
out that blew everyone's minds.

414
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:06,250
There's a recent book, No Rules Rules I think
it's called.

415
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:10,679
And it feels like Netflix has done a great
job at maintaining its culture.

416
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,200
It feels to me there's these three important
elements, and maybe there's more.

417
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,850
One is very high talent density and a focus
on high performers.

418
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,980
Two is candor and being really direct.

419
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:26,049
And then three is giving people freedom and
responsibility and getting rid of useless

420
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,090
processes like vacation time and things like
that.

421
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:34,970
So maybe just to dive into that first one
of high talent density and this focus on high

422
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,970
performance.

423
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,500
I guess the question there is just like, what
does this look like in Netflix?

424
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,090
And I imagine part of it is hiring, part of
it is performance reviews.

425
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,170
And then just why is it so important?

426
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:48,539
Why is this such a focus on Netflix?

427
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,280
What happens when you have such a high talent
density?

428
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,120
It's just so intrinsic to who Netflix is as
a company.

429
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,049
And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed
Hastings as founder of Netflix.

430
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:11,110
So when he founded Netflix and grew the company
over time, it was with a belief that there

431
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:17,600
could be a different approach to building
a company that would make it a place that

432
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,429
people thrived in and loved being and would
feel different than other places, both in

433
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:27,350
the quality of that talent density, but even
more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes

434
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,620
and that that's where people would derive
a lot of sense of fulfillment.

435
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:37,520
So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from
its original days.

436
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,700
A big piece of that talent density is definitely
hiring.

437
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,190
So who are the people coming in and joining
the team?

438
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:54,100
But a lot of it is, we can't really have any
of the other aspects of the culture, including

439
00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:00,980
candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement,
freedom and responsibility if you don't start

440
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,590
with high talent density.

441
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:12,100
And so in some ways it's not the end, it's
the means to the end in what Reed and the

442
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,360
rest of the leadership team has been trying
to build.

443
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,529
And so in order to do that, you have to really
hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't

444
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,200
feel like natural human behavior.

445
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:33,000
What I mean by that is giving the feedback,
this gets into the second bucket.

446
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:39,030
So giving feedback, being candid around your
expectations when they're not being met, what

447
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,899
could be better in helping people improve,
and be able to receive that type of feedback

448
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:48,250
yourself in order to keep talent density high?

449
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:53,169
Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect
human being and stays a perfect human being

450
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,169
the whole time.

451
00:30:54,169 --> 00:30:57,360
We all have ways that we could grow and improve.

452
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,610
And so in order to keep that bar high, you
have to be willing to have those types of

453
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,350
very uncomfortable conversations.

454
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,740
It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and
feedback in order to keep that bar high.

455
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,090
And then the other piece of it is another
thing that doesn't come naturally to humans,

456
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:27,450
which is making a call in pretty timely fashion
if someone's not able to meet the bar, and

457
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:32,639
to say either, "I don't think the role you're
sitting in is the right role, or I don't think

458
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:40,820
that Netflix is the right place for you,"
and to make that something that is part of

459
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,350
best practice to get to a point where you
could make that decision.

460
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,010
And that's where we refer to the keepers test,
which is really just a mental framing to make

461
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,400
sure we hold ourselves accountable for this.

462
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:00,149
Where if I'm asking myself the question, "If
this person on my team came to me and said,

463
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:01,929
'I'm leaving today.

464
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:06,120
I have a different opportunity and I would
like to take it,' would I do everything I

465
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,889
could to keep them at Netflix?"

466
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:14,049
If not, then I should be having that tough
conversation about, "Should you really be

467
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:15,049
here?

468
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,120
Are you in the right role?", if I might be
a little bit relieved if you said you were

469
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,040
leaving.

470
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,179
The reason the keeper test and that question
is useful is because no one wants to think

471
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:25,179
that way.

472
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:28,350
It's very hard to say to someone, "I think
this isn't the right fit.

473
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,889
I think you should move on from the company."

474
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:37,000
So we have to introduce some of those reflections
in order to encourage the behavior.

475
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,230
And we also then want to get to a place where
when you're having that tough conversation,

476
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,899
people aren't surprised by it.

477
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,450
That is easier said than done.

478
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,470
But you can only get to that conversation
around, "I don't think Netflix and you are

479
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:56,210
the right fit for one another" if you've been
giving feedback along the way.

480
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:02,830
And so it feels like in its most ideal state,
it's a mutual observation.

481
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,130
In practice, it's not always that smooth.

482
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,500
Obviously we are humans.

483
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,190
But that all feeds on itself in order to make
sure that we're really holding ourselves to

484
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,549
what we say our behavioral norms as part of
the culture.

485
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,450
How is that operationalized?

486
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,230
Is that just mental model that you should
have in mind?

487
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:24,049
Or is it like every quarter you should go
through this exercise?

488
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,040
Is it part of the performance review process?

489
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,419
How does that actually operationalize at Netflix?

490
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:31,120
It's definitely a mental model.

491
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,059
So when we talk to managers about what does
it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would

492
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,780
mean you should be with some frequency asking
yourself this about the people on your team.

493
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:47,620
People ask me frequently, "Am I passing your
keeper test?"

494
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:55,149
So it becomes part of a regular manager direct
report, one on one.

495
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:58,870
And it is just another way of saying, "Am
I meeting your expectations?

496
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,870
What's going well?

497
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,870
What's not going well?

498
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:03,059
How are you thinking about things?"

499
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,390
And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation
to have.

500
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,300
So in the middle of a lot of like, "We have
to talk about this project or that deliverable

501
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:16,329
or this thing that's happening," to take the
time to step back and just say, "How am I

502
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:19,770
doing?", can feel loaded sometimes.

503
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,790
And the keeper test, while it feels like a
very heavy concept, creates a lightness around

504
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,370
being able to have that conversation regularly.

505
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,750
So we do operationalize it.

506
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,250
A point that you made, I'll just clarify,
we don't have performance reviews.

507
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,740
Oh, wow.

508
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,460
So we don't have a practice that a lot of
other companies do where we would think about

509
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,950
reflecting on a rating of how things are going.

510
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:49,899
We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback
where you request and receive feedback from

511
00:34:49,899 --> 00:34:54,760
a lot of people, but it's not an input to
some output, it's just for the value of the

512
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,910
feedback and to make sure we're keeping that
muscle.

513
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:03,510
And we have an annual compensation cycle where
we reflect on how are people doing?

514
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:09,980
And so you think about performance as part
of both promotions and as part of compensation,

515
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:16,440
but in that way it has to be part of the day-to-day
and part of the operating rhythm because we

516
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,100
don't create a process where that would come
to the surface.

517
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,100
Interesting.

518
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,100
I didn't know that.

519
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,609
So the idea there is just ongoing, like the
whole...

520
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:28,099
So what many people dream of, no performance
reviews, we'll give you ongoing real-time

521
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,099
feedback.

522
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,619
We don't have to wait six months.

523
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:36,670
I feel like people talk about this but rarely
do this, but that's how you guys operate.

524
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,670
In ideal.

525
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,000
In ideal, yeah.

526
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
In practice.

527
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,210
It's like you have to keep reminding yourself,
"This is our ideal" because it's really easy

528
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,600
to rely on the annual 360 cycle.

529
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,920
And all of a sudden I do get about 300 pieces
of feedback.

530
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,650
And some of those things are on things that
happened six months ago and I think, "Oh,

531
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,560
I wish you had told me this at the time, that
would've been more living the Netflix culture."

532
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,600
So we have to push ourselves to do it that
way.

533
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,410
But yeah, that is if working well, it's very
timely direct feedback.

534
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,160
The 360 site goal is sort of the annual check-in
on, "Let me get the full picture.

535
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,910
Let me be able to distill some themes.

536
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,099
Let me tee it up for a conversation with my
manager."

537
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:29,700
And then it does remove the sort of crutch
of an every six month performance review or

538
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
something like that.

539
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,430
When you talked about this example of someone
asking you often, "Am I meeting your keeper

540
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,980
test?", it makes me feel like someone's just
super nervous.

541
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,329
They're like, "Am I passing your keeper test?"

542
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:45,569
And it makes me feel like it could create
a culture of just like a lot of stress and

543
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:50,500
worry and this hunger games mentality of like,
"I got to compete and worry and I might die

544
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,910
or get fired any day."

545
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,350
I'm guessing the solution to that is partly
cultural.

546
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:56,710
This is just the way we work.

547
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,980
You don't need to stress all the time, but
you may be let go if you're not meeting this

548
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,520
keeper test.

549
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,460
How do you avoid this just constant worry
that you might be fired any day and that you

550
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,819
may not be hitting the bar?

551
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:20,380
In my personal experience, I have felt a lot
more at ease by having these conversations

552
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:22,660
than by not having them.

553
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:30,510
So in many roles I've had, I haven't been
sure how I was doing or things I could be

554
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,619
doing better on, and I didn't quite know how
to get that information.

555
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:43,310
And that made me feel much more stressed or
nervous or at risk than having it be part

556
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,430
of the culture to have those conversations.

557
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,720
So the thing that I think can be nerve wracking,
and I feel it myself, is the high bar for

558
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:58,349
excellence at Netflix and if we're doing this
while you're surrounded by amazing people.

559
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:04,210
And that can feed a sense of, "Am I doing
well enough compared to how everyone else

560
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:05,410
is doing?

561
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,350
I know the bar's high."

562
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:13,550
For the most part, that can drive people and
in a good way, but in some ways it makes people

563
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,550
nervous.

564
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,900
And that's where I think it's helpful to know
we expect to have these conversations so you

565
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:24,890
can just kind of let your shoulders relax
a little bit of, "Yes, the expectations are

566
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,682
high, but my manager says I'm doing a great
job, or my manager says I'm not doing a great

567
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:33,600
job, but they gave me concrete things that
I could do better."

568
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,380
And so I think knowing is better than not.

569
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,319
And so in that sense, it's the culture combined
with the conversations around performance

570
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,200
I hope take a little bit of that stress out
of it.

571
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,319
But I've certainly heard it a lot that without
that conversation, people can be nervous.

572
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:55,260
That's such a good point and such a good example
that I feel like every company wants to have

573
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,450
a high bar and have only high performers and
keep the bar really high for every person

574
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,450
they hire.

575
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,680
I'm curious, I know this could be its own
podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring

576
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,390
people that are amazing and keeping this bar
of excellence, is there anything you can point

577
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,869
out that might be helpful to other companies
hiring to help identify amazing people and

578
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:18,480
make sure that bar stays high?

579
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,589
One thing I know is you guys pay a top market
for salary.

580
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:27,190
I think that's one unique thing about Netflix,
is we just pay people.

581
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,740
So maybe that's an part of this answer, but
just what advice do you have for people to

582
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,600
keep a really high bar in their talent?

583
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:40,180
Yeah, I mean on the compensation point, we
pay what we call personal top of market, meaning

584
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:46,250
we want to be highly competitive in the pay,
but we don't want pay to be like the golden

585
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:55,990
handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than
paying people a strongly competitive compensation.

586
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:04,700
So I think that that's important for attracting
and retaining talent and has been a big part

587
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:12,240
of the culture, but almost more importantly,
we hope we don't have to rely on that to want

588
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,640
people to want to be at Netflix or for us
to be able to assess whether people are going

589
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,000
to thrive at Netflix.

590
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,710
The way that I've thought about hiring with
that context is we know we're going to offer

591
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:32,790
you very highly competitive compensation,
but are you going to come to Netflix and help

592
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:40,339
us identify the right problems to solve or
new ways to solve existing problems?

593
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:47,089
And that's a different way of hiring than
you might think about, especially at scale

594
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:51,349
where you're saying, "Does this person have
this skill, this skill, this skill?

595
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,510
Check they're going to fit in this box and
they're going to deliver this work that I

596
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,690
need them to do."

597
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,960
I'm being intentionally simplistic.

598
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,740
I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually
that way.

599
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,420
But at Netflix we try really hard to say we're
looking for the new perspective or the person

600
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,590
who's actually going to make us stronger as
a team.

601
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:14,240
So thinking about additive skills, additive
perspectives, people who are going to push

602
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,840
our thinking on something.

603
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:23,020
That tends to help us with thinking about
talent density because you're constantly introducing

604
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,530
people to the team who uplevel.

605
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:29,430
So then the questions you have to ask in an
interview might be different because yes,

606
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:34,140
we're trying to assess do you have the baseline
skills to be successful here, but we're also

607
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,450
looking for the things that make people exceptional
or even stronger than the team we've got.

608
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:44,400
And then you think about making the magical
teams comprised of all those amazing minds

609
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,190
and what can you get out of that.

610
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,490
And that feels like more that the talent density
and practice.

611
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,490
Got it.

612
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,920
So the advice there essentially is, don't
look for someone just simply great.

613
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,790
Look for someone that raises the bar for the
whole team, brings in a whole new perspective.

614
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:58,790
Yes.

615
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:59,790
That's a great way to say it.

616
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,790
Yeah, it's a good way to say it.

617
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:04,990
I think what's great about this idea of just
maintaining excellence consistently is that

618
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,190
the best people want to work with the best
people.

619
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,760
And as soon as there's one person that sucks
and the company allows for that, it just brings

620
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,520
everyone down because they know, "Hey, we
can be okay.

621
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,130
We'll stick or no one's going to do anything
about it."

622
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:22,730
And when you make it clear, we only want the
best and only hire the best and only keep

623
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:26,069
the best, it keeps the best there, right?

624
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:28,670
I imagine that's part of the strategy.

625
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:29,670
Yeah.

626
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,810
It's definitely the goal.

627
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:36,589
And I think understanding that having gaps
in the team and people's skillsets or their

628
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:40,360
behavior can be really toxic for other people
on the team.

629
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,760
So it's a cost.

630
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,470
This episode is brought to you by Xplo, a
game changer for customer facing analytics

631
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,140
and data reporting.

632
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,500
Are your users craving more dashboards, reports,
and analytics within your product?

633
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,109
Are you tired of trying to build it yourself?

634
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:59,690
As a product leader, you probably have these
requests on your roadmap, but the struggle

635
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,150
to prioritize them is real.

636
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:07,030
Building analytics from scratch can be time-consuming,
expensive, and a really challenging process.

637
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:09,000
Enter Xplo.

638
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,720

Once you're ready, simply embed the dashboard
or report into your application with a tiny

644
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:30,730
code snippet.

645
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,850
The best part?

646
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:37,090
Your end users can use Xplo's AI features
for their own report and dashboard generation,

647
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:40,530

That's E-X-P-L-O.co/lenny.

651
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:58,180
So I asked on Twitter what questions to ask
you.

652
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,200
And there's a great question that came in
from Nan Yu.

653
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,040
He's the head of product for Linear and he
asks, "What practices does Netflix do that

654
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,980
other companies should not attempt to do because
their talent level is so much higher than

655
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:15,300
other companies?"

656
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,180
That is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell.

657
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,260
So let me explain that.

658
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,880
It's a good question.

659
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,270
It's kind of related to what I was saying
earlier, that talent density is a prerequisite

660
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:32,380
for a lot of the other ways we operate.

661
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:43,190
So if we want to create a work environment
where we are not prescriptive about how people

662
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:50,410
solve problems or the scope of problems that
they could tackle, assuming they're highly

663
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:57,559
impactful for the business, and we don't have
a lot of process around that work, so think

664
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:07,390
about being able to make large innovations
to our engineering systems or introducing

665
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:14,339
new ways to think about metrics and experimentation,
we get a lot of those things because we give

666
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:22,089
people the freedom and the space to explore
and question things and experiment in a way

667
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:24,940
with solutions.

668
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,970
I think that that would be very hard if not
dangerous if we didn't have a high talent

669
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,430
density.

670
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:39,680
It's really not a top down do A, then B, then
C. Even in how we go through some of our planning

671
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:47,900
processes or thinking about how we think about
priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution

672
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,880
across all levels of the team and that requires
talent density.

673
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:56,150
And then there's things like you have to have
amazing people if you're not going to have

674
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:02,120
really strict guardrails that would influence
the consumer experience or business stakeholders

675
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,120
experience.

676
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,829
We do give people a lot of responsibility
on those things.

677
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:14,160
So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness
is all hinging on we've got amazing people

678
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,960
who are smart, but even better have strong
judgment.

679
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,200
This is kind of what you always hear from
people giving founders advice is, "Just hire

680
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:30,570
amazing people, get out of their way and let
them do their job," which is often not a successful

681
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,309
experience.

682
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:37,140
What are examples that either things that
came out of this freedom, I don't know, products

683
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:41,800
or features or ideas that came out of this
or policies or processes you don't have that

684
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,800
everyone else might have?

685
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
So I know there's no vacation time, there's
unlimited vacation time, I assume.

686
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,270
Is that still a thing?

687
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,440
Unlimited vacation time?

688
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Yeah.

689
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,900
Okay, cool.

690
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,360
All right, great.

691
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,050
And I know performance reviews, you talked
about that.

692
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:59,010
So I guess in either direction, is there an
example of something that came out of this

693
00:46:59,010 --> 00:47:03,210
freedom or some process that which surprised
people that you don't have or a framework

694
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,730
or system?

695
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,099
We've been able to deliver...

696
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:14,290
I'll speak to my own team around innovations
in our content delivery network or innovations

697
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:19,190
in encoding or innovations in discovery and
personalization.

698
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:24,240
We're not driven by some leader saying, "I
think this is a priority."

699
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,349
They were driven in many cases by individual
contributors who had great ideas for innovation.

700
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:35,520
So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded
in, came from creating space for people on

701
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
the team.

702
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,770
So there's probably thousands of examples
of product features and things like that that

703
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,520
came out of creating this space.

704
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:47,780
And right now, the trick is finding the sweet
spot so that we can operate efficiently at

705
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:53,970
this type of scale without snuffing out some
of that, what was kind of the core beauty

706
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:55,380
of the culture.

707
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,090
Maybe a last question around just the culture.

708
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:59,760
We talked about candor a bit.

709
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,400
I'm just curious if there's an example that
comes to mind of an example of candor that

710
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:08,800
you recently saw or had to be the candid person
that might be interesting to share where it's

711
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,319
like, "Oh wow, that's what you mean when you
say a culture of candor."

712
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:16,900
There's a couple things that come to mind.

713
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:26,000
I am generally a transparent leader, meaning
I share information freely and openly.

714
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,230
It's part of the culture to context, not control,
which means part of my job is to make sure

715
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,170
that people have the context they need to
do their jobs well.

716
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:42,290
And in practice, that means I take notes in
leadership meetings and I share those notes

717
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:45,000
with the whole organization.

718
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,590
And that is sometimes it includes candor around
reflections on things that aren't going well

719
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,079
or problems we need to solve.

720
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,359
Sometimes it's just letting people know, "Here's
what leadership's talking about so that they

721
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:00,680
have a sense of what's top of mind."

722
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,270
But it's a version of transparency that I
feel strongly about, doesn't exist a lot of

723
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,710
other places.

724
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:10,410
I think it's a version of candor too in being
able to share...

725
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,480
I can't always share every detail of everything
that we're talking about, but I do try to

726
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,950
share things that probably push the boundary
a little bit in the team, feeling like they

727
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,970
understand what's happening across the company
and what I'm thinking about.

728
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:29,491
And then there's a second example that comes
to mind, which is, until two years ago, individual

729
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:32,990
contributors didn't have levels at Netflix.

730
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:38,270
So all engineers were just senior engineers,
all data scientists were senior data scientists,

731
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:42,460
and we did not have a leveling system.

732
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,630
We introduced IC levels two years ago almost
exactly.

733
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:54,050
And it was a big, big, big shift because it
was seen as something that was sort of sacred

734
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,050
of it.

735
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:57,180
A lot of people came to Netflix because we
didn't have it.

736
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,660
We didn't have process around promotions.

737
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:04,020
This is probably part of why we never had
performance reviews, because promotions really

738
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,099
weren't at play.

739
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,460
And it gave people a sense of freedom of not
having to worry about that type of structure.

740
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,950
But when you get to a scale of an organization,
we needed some type of scaffolding to say,

741
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,839
"We want to talk about how we compose teams.

742
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,570
When do we need the person who has 30 years
of experience?

743
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:23,920
When do we want to have a new grad?"

744
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,790
Because that's what the work requires.

745
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,050
We didn't have a language for it.

746
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:36,660
So I introduced Levels a couple of years ago
and we had quite a change rollercoaster is

747
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,210
the only way I can describe how it went.

748
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,900
That's a good phrase.

749
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,359
Yeah, it was sort of like being the tumble
dry machine for a few months, and so really

750
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:47,869
talking through it with the team.

751
00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:51,130
That's just context and backdrop.

752
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:57,950
For an example of candor recently, which is,
we had kind of a postmortem or a retro on

753
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:01,170
how has it gone with IC levels.

754
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,710
So it's kind of like wells, not wells.

755
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,809
And I would normally think in a lot of cultures
it would be like, "Well, we got past that

756
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:10,809
change.

757
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,730
We're living that change."

758
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:13,730
Don't reflect on it.

759
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,710
Because that kind of opened some of that early
debate.

760
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:18,119
And I felt differently about it.

761
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,210
I think it's a good example of being candid
about, this was a big change for us.

762
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:24,010
It hasn't all gone perfectly.

763
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:27,990
There's a lot that we can do better in how
we implement levels at Netflix.

764
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,859
And I would rather share that information
than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and

765
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:34,290
we achieved every objective.

766
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:40,120
So I think that I try to build examples like
that because I do think that level of candor

767
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,510
and reflection helps build the sense of community
and trust across the team.

768
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,869
That's an awesome example.

769
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:52,390
Kind of along the lines of that, but also
this category of freedom and responsibility,

770
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:56,290
something Netflix innovated long ago, and
I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this

771
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:02,260
idea of Chaos Monkeys, which essentially are
a program that runs on your infrastructure

772
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:08,390
that just kills random processes and things
and just to see what breaks and make sure

773
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,559
things are stable when things actually start
falling apart.

774
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,290
Is Chaos Monkeys...

775
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,290
Was that what it's called?

776
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,290
And then is that still a thing?

777
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:19,890
Is there still some Chaos Monkeys running
around the servers?

778
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,119
Not unbridled Chaos Monkeys.

779
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,119
No.

780
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,119
Okay.

781
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:25,119
Contains chaos and niche.

782
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,130
Bur no, we carry too much responsibility,
speaking of freedom and responsibility for

783
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:43,470
the member experience to inject pain, though
we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience,

784
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:50,030
and that does probably mean injecting things
that we're not quite sure whether A is better

785
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:56,000
than B. And so that happens across engineering
systems really at scale.

786
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:02,400
But it is not for pure chaos, it's for intentional
learning and so we can avoid making bigger

787
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,799
mistakes.

788
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:11,550
And then as we go into new efforts like cloud
games, we have a beta that's out now, Live

789
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:13,600
would be another example.

790
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:19,540
We do try to come up with intentionally low
profile examples where we can test the bounds

791
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:25,250
of our systems in a way that's unlikely to
damage the member experience.

792
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:28,640
But that's less randomness, more by design.

793
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,410
And so we're doing that in a few places that
feels mostly good engineering practice so

794
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:39,980
we can understand when it's really showtime
and we're going to really test our systems,

795
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,240
will they be able to perform like we want
them to.

796
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,839
RIP Chaos Monkey.

797
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,630
Yeah.

798
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:55,500
So kind of along these lines of data, so data
itself has always been at the heart of Netflix.

799
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,970
My understanding is the way the data team
and the insights team is structured has been

800
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,970
one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful.

801
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:08,150
And that's the team you led before you moved
into this new role.

802
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:13,210
Can you just talk about how these teams are
structured and why this structure is so effective?

803
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:14,210
Yeah.

804
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:17,730
I certainly like to think of it as being special.

805
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,730
It's unusual.

806
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,829
I can explain why.

807
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:31,240
So the scale of company that Netflix now is
very often data oriented teams are embedded

808
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,180
in other parts of the business.

809
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:40,220
So it could either be they're embedded in
a business line like ads or games, or they

810
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:49,180
are organized more functionally separating
data engineers from data scientists, from

811
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,110
analytics engineers, from consumer researchers.

812
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:59,210
We've resisted that and kept a centralized
team that is both functionally diverse.

813
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:05,970
So across all those types of functions that
I just described and works on nearly every

814
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,339
area of the business from within the team.

815
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:17,400
I sort of understand why a lot of companies
move away from this because it really does

816
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:25,500
require basically extraordinary partnership
that we would have people working on data

817
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:30,440
problems that don't report into the teams
that are relying on them.

818
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,880
But the benefit we get is we get to think
about our functional expertise.

819
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:41,109
So are we really world's best data engineers,
world's best data scientists?

820
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:47,799
And how do we continue to be ever better from
a functional and technical perspective?

821
00:55:47,799 --> 00:55:52,119
It gives people better career paths because
there's more mobility across the teams.

822
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:55,799
It feels like a team that has a functional
expertise with a lot of different problems

823
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:56,799
to solve.

824
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:03,470
And so I think it enables more cross-pollination
of ideas in a way.

825
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,440
It also allows us to be really objective.

826
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,920
That is probably the most important thing,
that our job is not to tell the story that

827
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,810
someone wants to hear with the data or to
solve the problem that someone thinks is most

828
00:56:17,810 --> 00:56:18,810
important.

829
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,370
It's for us to have our own perspective about
things.

830
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:30,260
I think that that uplevels the whole organization
because it means that we're able to be truth

831
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:37,819
tellers or to be curious in a way that might
not fit if we had a different organizational

832
00:56:37,819 --> 00:56:38,819
structure.

833
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:43,840
We have to balance, that would be a good partner,
deliver on the things we agreed were priorities,

834
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,470
be flexible with how we're spending our time,
but it gives us agency and responsibility

835
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:50,960
beyond that.

836
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,119
And I feel like the team takes that very seriously.

837
00:56:53,119 --> 00:57:00,031
So I've seen examples of that in how we bring
data to a lot of spaces, including how we

838
00:57:00,031 --> 00:57:04,440
partner with engineering on data related topics
or how we partner with content that I'm not

839
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,720
sure we would've gotten to if not for having
that kernel that's sort of a center of excellence

840
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,619
around it.

841
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,990
And it's Data and Insights, that was the team
that you ran.

842
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:19,160
Insights, is that describing user research
or what does that have function actually?

843
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,740
So part of Data and Insights is a Consumer
Insights team that includes a lot of different

844
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,480
flavors of research really.

845
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,950
So in some ways, consumer is even a misnomer
because there's parts of the team that do

846
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:37,440
internal research, for example, on tools and
products for our studio productions.

847
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,510
So that's more of a user research oriented
versus consumer.

848
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:46,910
And then the parts of that team that are consumer
oriented do things all the way from content

849
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:52,079
screenings to make titles the best version
of themselves before they're on the service

850
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:59,809
to more traditional UX research to think about
how can we deliver the best title discovery

851
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:04,450
experience or how can we think about things
that improve accessibility?

852
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:06,490
And then that team has a global remit.

853
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:11,559
So there's also teams that are more local
or regional expertise in understanding consumer

854
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,849
needs and entertainment.

855
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:20,210
So Consumer Insights and a team, formerly
known as still kind of known as a shorthand,

856
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:25,619
data science and engineering, combined together
to create data and insights probably about

857
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,140
two years ago.

858
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,380
That's another piece that's unusual.

859
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:33,520
It becomes truly a full stack data and research
expertise.

860
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:39,760
And so we could tackle a problem like, what's
the right way to think about recommendations

861
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:44,950
and how best to surface them in a way that
combines attitudinal research, qualitative

862
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:50,210
and quantitative with behavioral research
on more of the data science, data engineering

863
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,310
analytics side.

864
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:55,839
It's super cool because I think it's really
rare that what people think of user research

865
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,579
is within the data org.

866
00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:01,950
And I think that might be a solution to some
of the backlash a lot of user research teams

867
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,440
get where they're like, I don't know, what
are you guys doing all this anecdotal evidence

868
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,390
if it's under the same org.

869
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:12,830
I feel like that leads to a lot more credibility
and avoid this like, "Oh, data's telling me

870
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:13,830
this thing.

871
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:15,920
This user research team is telling me this
thing.

872
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,410
What should we do?"

873
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:23,829
Yeah, I mean, Consumer Insights is one of
the newer teams for me, it wasn't in my background

874
00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:30,980
to lead a team like that and not in my individual
training, but they are critical for making

875
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:36,109
sure we keep a consumer orientation, a member
orientation on things.

876
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:42,210
I have loved to watch the teams collaborate
on problems because we talk about it as a

877
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:45,790
superpower internally in combining those skill
sets.

878
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,789
So I think the Consumer Insights team at Netflix
has had a lot of credibility in a certain

879
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:55,450
area of expertise and we took it to the next
level by combining it with other of the functional

880
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,450
expertise.

881
00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,510
So it's not required in every problem space.

882
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:03,920
So we try not to overdo it and say we need
to be collaborating everywhere because that

883
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,500
just feels like the wrong expectation, but
we try to make the most of it in spaces where

884
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
we really benefit.

885
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,030
So yeah, it's worked out really well.

886
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,030
Awesome.

887
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:15,030
Okay.

888
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,170
I want to ask two more questions before we
get to our very exciting lightning around.

889
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:22,880
And they're both skills that [inaudible 01:00:39] little birdies
have told me you're very good at.

890
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,089
One is that you are very intentional and thoughtful
about staying close to individual teams and

891
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:34,170
individuals within the company, even though
you're higher and higher in the org.

892
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:38,809
I'm curious how you do that, how you actually
practice this skill of staying really close

893
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:45,480
to teams at the bottom of the ladder and individuals
that are working on things on the ground basically?

894
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:53,559
A lot of it is how I spend my time and fighting
to preserve opportunities to connect with

895
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:54,559
people.

896
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:03,130
So examples would be, I still have biweekly
office hours, people sign up for slots.

897
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:07,309
It can feel a little like speed dating for
20 minute slots, but I get to meet a whole

898
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:14,450
bunch of people and hear about work, hear
what's top of mind.

899
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:20,720
People book them out many months ahead and
it's just an opportunity to stay in touch.

900
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:27,069
And then I do Ask Me Anything sessions with
teams of different sizes depending on how

901
01:01:27,069 --> 01:01:34,559
intimate we want it to feel, but truly anything
is fair game as a way to get to know me as

902
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:40,039
a person, for me to hear questions, to try
to be candid about what I can answer or can't

903
01:01:40,039 --> 01:01:41,039
answer.

904
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:47,390
And so those things have helped me maintain
connection, but both of those examples are

905
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:50,450
about making the time for it.

906
01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:57,510
So what I have found as my role has changed
is that it just wouldn't happen if I didn't

907
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,010
make it a priority.

908
01:02:00,010 --> 01:02:04,490
And then through those types of sessions,
I do think I become or I hope to become more

909
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:08,230
approachable so people know, "You can send
me a Slack message, you can send me an email.

910
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,140
Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to respond
to you as quickly as I can because I want

911
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,650
to hold myself to that bar."

912
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:20,030
And so that builds a flow of communication
between me and the team that I really value...

913
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:23,760
I don't think I would want to do my job if
I didn't have those points of connection,

914
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,760
so that helps too.

915
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:28,410
And you also send that email to everyone after
every leadership meeting, so they're like,

916
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:29,460
"Oh yeah, Elizabeth."

917
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,869
Yeah, they hear from me.

918
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:31,869
Yeah.

919
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:35,779
Kind of related to this, so we have a mutual
friend, that's how we got connected.

920
01:02:35,779 --> 01:02:39,690
Ali Rao, she was a data scientist at Airbnb,
now she's at Uber.

921
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:45,890
She had a question that she wanted me to ask,
and it's about how good you are at being present.

922
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:48,660
So her question is something she's noticed
about.

923
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:53,559
"Something I've noticed about her is how 100%
present she is no matter who she talks to.

924
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:56,950
Do you have any advice for people to get better
at this?

925
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:59,650
Because it's so hard in the day of email and
iPhones and Slack."

926
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:05,010
Her questions like, "When does she respond
to stuff if not sometimes in meetings?"

927
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:14,819
I actually think I'm the most present when
I'm having conversations like this one.

928
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:22,839
I do preserve a lot of time to have one-on-one
conversations where I'm genuinely curious

929
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:31,779
about how someone's doing, how I can help
them, what they're excited about that's authentic.

930
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:40,490
And so while my EA would probably cringe at
saying I like to spend time doing a lot of

931
01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:46,390
those one-on-ones, it is relatively easier
for me to say the human connection is part

932
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,319
of what I enjoy about this.

933
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:53,390
I think that's true for a lot of people in
what we get out of work and life, but I try

934
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:55,390
to live that in those meetings.

935
01:03:55,390 --> 01:04:00,529
I'm probably not as good when we're talking
about meetings of 30 people and I'm multitasking,

936
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:03,099
so I'll admit to doing that for sure.

937
01:04:03,099 --> 01:04:09,140
But I think the one-on-one conversations I
treat as being pretty sacred.

938
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:12,720
One of the things I've noticed that helps
me continue to invest in that and maybe is

939
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:24,240
helpful for other people is some of my greatest
friends and connections, including people

940
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,270
like Ali are people I met along the way professionally.

941
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:34,799
So I worked very closely with Ally's husband,
Keith Henwood, at multiple places, both analysis

942
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,140
group and at Lyft.

943
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:41,859
And that means that it's created opportunities
and it's been points of connection.

944
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:44,829
And so you get back what you give basically.

945
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:50,150
There are people in my life who are part of
my life because I worked with them or because

946
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,150
I crossed paths.

947
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:58,100
And I like to think that if I can make a positive
mark on them, it'll come back and be a at

948
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,150
some point too.

949
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:02,279
So I think to distill that is that I truly
enjoy it.

950
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:05,340
It's what I get out of especially work.

951
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:07,799
And then it's my community.

952
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:09,940
And that's served me really well over time.

953
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:15,020
And so I have given people advice of, "This
is a small community, think about what you're

954
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:19,160
investing in other people because that will
matter down the line for yourself too" and

955
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,260
I try to live that myself.

956
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,099
Yeah, that's such good advice.

957
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,789
There's kind of two things that come to mind
there.

958
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:27,900
One is treat people the way you want to be
treated.

959
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,270
Someone once said that maybe.

960
01:05:30,270 --> 01:05:34,170
And I think you've come back to this a couple
times, this idea of just pay attention to

961
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:38,779
what gives you energy and that you're good
at and just almost double down on that.

962
01:05:38,779 --> 01:05:41,750
Just make that more and more of a superpower.

963
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,529
Yeah, that last part resonates.

964
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:54,190
It's been a big part of my personal and professional
practice to reflect on how I'm feeling, what

965
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:58,630
I'm excited about, what I'm enjoying.

966
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:04,430
I do think it helps me be more grounded, which
maybe helps me be more present or helps me

967
01:06:04,430 --> 01:06:06,299
be a better manager or leader.

968
01:06:06,299 --> 01:06:11,299
That might be part of the secret sauce too,
but it is part of my practice.

969
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:13,440
I can't help but ask, is this an actual practice?

970
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,890
Do you do this on a regular basis or is this
just something you think about like, "I should

971
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,460
reflect back"?

972
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:25,250
I wish I was so advanced to say I meditate
and I create all this structure.

973
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:32,160
It's more that I think I mentioned maybe I'm
an introvert, so I do spend some time alone.

974
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,779
That's how I recharge.

975
01:06:34,779 --> 01:06:39,609
And early mornings, especially people who
know me sometimes are horrified at the time

976
01:06:39,609 --> 01:06:46,880
of day I send emails, but early mornings are
a quiet time for me where I do try to have

977
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:52,170
a daily check-in of just how are things going,
why am I feeling anxious, why am I feeling

978
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,170
excited.

979
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,241
And it's kind of a muscle you build.

980
01:06:54,241 --> 01:06:58,299
So while I don't write in a journal, I don't
have a meditation practice, I do have a time

981
01:06:58,299 --> 01:07:05,430
of day when I try to keep it protected from
other things so that I can think for a second.

982
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:08,980
What I think about there is Jeff Bezos has
this approach in the morning.

983
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,130
He just calls, he putters around.

984
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,520
He has no meetings until I think 10:00 or
something.

985
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:18,150
He just wants to putter around, read the newspaper,
see what's going on in email, which I'm trying

986
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:19,150
to do.

987
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:20,150
I really like that.

988
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,150
That feels really good.

989
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:22,150
I'm just going to putter around.

990
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:23,150
I have no responsibilities in the morning.

991
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,460
I've never heard that.

992
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,859
I'm going to adopt that language.

993
01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:27,859
[inaudible 01:07:46].

994
01:07:27,859 --> 01:07:28,859
"I'm just puttering."

995
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:30,059
Putter and puttering.

996
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,849
Elizabeth, is there anything else you wanted
to touch on or leave listeners with before

997
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:37,540
we get to our very exciting lightning round?

998
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:40,880
No, I'm ready for the exciting lightning round.

999
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:44,450
Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting
lightning round.

1000
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:49,319
First question, what are two or three books
that you've recommended most to other people?

1001
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:54,289
It's probably a little recency bias, but I've
been recommending What I Talk About When I

1002
01:07:54,289 --> 01:08:02,960
Talk About Running by Murakami, which talk
about introspection about the similarities

1003
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:09,000
between running and writing as sort of flow
states and very meditative things.

1004
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:17,190
So I had read some of his fiction books and
the autobiographical reflection on these types

1005
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:21,290
of either professions or hobbies I think is
very insightful.

1006
01:08:21,290 --> 01:08:22,740
So that's one.

1007
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:28,080
And then one of my longtime favorite books
is A Fine Balance by Mistry.

1008
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:36,859
And that is just a great story of human complexity
and challenge and relationships.

1009
01:08:36,859 --> 01:08:43,549
So I'm drawn to both books and TV and film
that are about humans.

1010
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:48,839
Speaking of TV and film, this is maybe a high
stakes question for someone that works in

1011
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:52,520
Netflix, do you have a favorite recent movie
or TV show?

1012
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:54,560
I'm not going to name all Netflix.

1013
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,780
That feels too much like an advertisement.

1014
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:05,730
Film, Triangle of Sadness is phenomenal if
you haven't seen it.

1015
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:12,070
And then I'll go Netflix for TV, Beef was
I thought hysterical.

1016
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:18,359
I'm an Ali Wong fan, but also just a pretty
unique storyline.

1017
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,190
And I think they just won a bunch of Emmys.

1018
01:09:20,190 --> 01:09:21,590
They did.

1019
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,590
Amazing.

1020
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:23,680
Good picks.

1021
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,680
Next question.

1022
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:28,270
Do you have a favorite interview question
that you like to ask candidates that you are

1023
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:29,750
interviewing?

1024
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,839
High talent density.

1025
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:38,940
I'm usually looking for the person who would
be better in my role than I am in my role.

1026
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:45,040
So I often ask people what would their priorities
be, what would they do differently if they

1027
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:46,210
had my job.

1028
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:50,980
Next question, do you have a favorite product
that you recently discovered that you really

1029
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:52,400
like?

1030
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:58,730
So while I carry the CTO title, I live a pretty
analog life.

1031
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:06,989
So my most recent product is a Fellow pour-over
coffee maker, which is actually part of my

1032
01:10:06,989 --> 01:10:12,360
morning ritual, which I'll now call puttering
around, where I take great lengths in my coffee

1033
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,930
making process because I find it calming.

1034
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:20,239
And then it's not a recent find, but I have
to shout out that my Peloton is probably the

1035
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:22,159
favorite product I own.

1036
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:23,699
The bike or the treadmill?

1037
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:24,699
Bike.

1038
01:10:24,699 --> 01:10:30,410
I'm a recovering outdoor cyclist, so it's
also kind of questionable if I can even admit

1039
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:37,239
to this, but that's why I would admit to I
love the Peloton despite being ideally an

1040
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,520
outdoor cyclist.

1041
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,390
I have questions about your cycling, but before
that question, do you have a favorite life

1042
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:48,760
motto that you often come back to or share
with friends or family that you find useful

1043
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:49,760
either in work or in life?

1044
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,120
My mom said something to me that has stuck
with me.

1045
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:58,670
I don't know if I live it very well, but the
phrase was, "Something good happens every

1046
01:10:58,670 --> 01:11:00,480
day."

1047
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:07,190
And the reason she said it was because she
was encouraging me to be more mindful about

1048
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:11,940
enjoying the small things in the day-to-day
rather than letting myself get caught up in

1049
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:14,230
the busyness.

1050
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:15,380
Beautiful.

1051
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:16,380
Final question.

1052
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:17,969
You're a big biker and triathlete.

1053
01:11:17,969 --> 01:11:25,460
I am curious what that sport and time has
given you in your career or in life.

1054
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:31,000
What benefits have you found from spending
so much time and energy, running, biking,

1055
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,220
being an athlete?

1056
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,670
Certainly by mental resilience.

1057
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:43,900
So while those sound like physical strength,
I've found especially endurance sports are

1058
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:51,310
much more mental and how you go through the
highs and lows and sustain and then coming

1059
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,610
back from challenge.

1060
01:11:52,610 --> 01:11:57,560
So those sports have had their highs and lows
and from the lows I've really learned how

1061
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,790
to recover and bounce back.

1062
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,120
So those feel like universally applicable
skills.

1063
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:09,780
You have such an interesting mix of athleticism
and then Netflix, what a good balance for

1064
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,780
life.

1065
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:14,880
This is going to give me permission to go
watch Netflix recording this on Friday afternoon.

1066
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,230
Elizabeth, you're awesome.

1067
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:17,610
Thank you so much for being here.

1068
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:18,610
Two final questions.

1069
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:22,140
Where can folks find you online if they want
to reach out and maybe follow up on things?

1070
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,571
And how can listeners be useful to you?

1071
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:30,960
You can always find me on LinkedIn, so definitely
reach out or ping me if you have questions

1072
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,210
or comments.

1073
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:46,449
I think the way the listeners can be useful
to me is being maybe curious about how they

1074
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:52,550
can show up even better in their lives now
that we've done this reflection on Netflix

1075
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:56,100
culture and how we show up for other people.

1076
01:12:56,100 --> 01:13:00,420
I would like to ask listeners to pay that
forward to people that they're working with

1077
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,210
and how they show up for them.

1078
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:03,210
Amazing.

1079
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,260
I love that.

1080
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:09,790
If you end up doing this and you're listening,
maybe leave a comment on YouTube or in Substack

1081
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:12,659
with something that you haven't covered about
yourself.

1082
01:13:12,659 --> 01:13:15,690
Elizabeth, thank you so much for being here.

1083
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:16,690
Thank you, Lenny.

1084
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:18,290
I hope you have a great weekend.

1085
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:19,290
Same.

1086
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,380
Bye everyone.

1087
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:22,430
