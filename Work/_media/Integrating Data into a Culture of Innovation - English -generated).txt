if I think about the scale of the

services that Netflix delivers I think

about the role that the culture plays in

the degree that you're innovating using

open source Technologies tell me a

little bit about the culture and how

that plays out so much of Netflix's

culture was shaped 20 plus years ago by

Reed Hastings who certainly is legendary

both as founder and until recently

co-ceo of Netflix but also just as an

amazing leader and disrupter and I think

that that embedded in the Netflix

culture from early days we don't want to

be fearful of placing big bets we want

to be constantly pushing ourselves to be

more Innovative and certainly more

excellent over time and we want to use

data and analytical thinking to really

try to make the best decisions we can

and that in some ways Netflix culture

kind of embodies the set of values that

Reid brought to Netflix in really early

days and amazingly we've sustained a lot

of that culture which means that unlike

some other companies I've worked at you

don't really need to fight and kind of

have sharp elbows to say I think we

should look at some of the data and

insights before we make a decision in

most rooms it's the first question that

someone would ask of what do we know

about this that's going to help us make

a better decision if we're going to

place a big Innovative bet in some way

what gives us some confidence that it's

going to go in a Direction that's

positive for us but balancing that with

data not always being enough and we need

some judgment we don't always have the

perfect data to answer every question

you can't predict which title is going

to be a hit as much as we wish we could

there are things that are just always

imperfect about it and so the Netflix

culture also expects a lot of judgment

and we expect that at every level of the

organization so there's kind of catch

phrases that show up in our public

culture memo that that sort of embody

those values so things like freedom and

responsibility in how you think about

your accountability for the outcomes and

the great degree of autonomy or

Independence you have in decision making

also things like context not control so

leaders should not be micromanaging we

should actually be expecting our teams

to bring great ideas to the table

they're often very close to the context

so they're able to say I think this is a

bet we should make or I think we should

think about this way to innovate or

question the status quo in some ways and

then we also have a cultural value

around closely aligned Loosely coupled

which means we want to all feel like we

understand what we're trying to achieve

and what our end goals are really that's

about the member experience and how we

can continue to improve that and be

grounded enough in what our strategy is

that independent groups can make

decisions without needing to feel like

we need consensus driven decision making

it really slows you down it means some

groups are less willing to take some

risk because you might have to jump

through a lot of Hoops to get approvals

and we've really tried to avoid those

things and have process and ways to

evaluate the quality of decision making

where it makes sense which I think is

very important that it's not everywhere

in a way that kind of limits our

velocity and learning and

experimentation and Innovation so it's

all so closely kind of interwoven in the

way we think about the culture and the

way data and Innovation shows up

throughout the company
