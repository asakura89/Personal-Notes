1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Have you ever had this experience where you're really good at what you

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
do, you're reliable, you're disciplined, and you're focused at it, and

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,040
people can depend on you to do your work, but you have noticed that

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
there are less experienced colleagues that are getting promoted ahead

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,680
of you?

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,950
Have you ever had that experience?

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,370
Is it frustrating?

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
And it kind of seems unfair.

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,670
What I wanna talk to you about today are three levels of value and

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
exactly why there are colleagues who are less experienced, maybe even

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,360
less educated, and they are getting ahead.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Their career trajectory goes a lot farther and a lot faster.

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,820
Why is that occurring?

14
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,020
I'm gonna share with you three levels of value to explain that, and

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
also how you can implement it in your career path so that you can get

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
ahead in your career path and take it to the next level and the

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
executive levels and beyond, right?

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
So when it comes to being good at what you do, being good at what you

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
do, disciplined, reliable, focused, that is you as an implementer.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Now, implementation is the first level of value.

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,260
Implementation.

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,490
At the level of value called implementation you are the doer.

23
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,950
They hire you because of a skill set that you have.

24
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
They hire you because you have technical knowledge and expertise.

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,280
They hire you because they expect you to be diligent, focused,

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
reliable, and be good at what you do.

27
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,850
So that is what you are doing.

28
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,350
That's the level of implementation.

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,220
Now, implementers are important.

30
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,490
We need them in society.

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,890
We need them in this world because implementers move things forward,

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,820
implementers get things done, and we require that.

33
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,220
But the problem with implement implementation is a lot of times you

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
can get stuck there at implementation.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,120
Have you ever noticed that being stuck at that level, right?

36
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Being stuck before, being a manager, being stuck at doing, putting

37
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
down your head and doing the work and not getting noticed, not being

38
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,960
visible.

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
You can get stuck there.

40
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,300
And the reason why that happens is because implementation is the

41
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
lowest level of value in the marketplace.

42
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,860
The marketplace values implementation the least, which is why if

43
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
you're operating at the level of the doer, you're the one who does

44
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
that thing.

45
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,010
If you're at that level, this is why you also have the least influence

46
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,650
at implementation.

47
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,740
You have the least impact, you have the least visibility, you have the

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
least acknowledgement, recognition because it is the lowest level of

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,360
value in the marketplace, marketplace value.

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,650
So what happens is that you go to the next level of value.

51
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
And before I talk about the next level of value, I invite you to

52
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
subscribe to my channel, ring the notification bell as well, because

53
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
every single week I release topics on this and so much more, right?

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
So let's talk about the second level of value.

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
Remember, the first level of value is implementation.

56
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,980
Now, what happens is that some people move to the next level of value

57
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
in the marketplace and they move from implementation to unification.

58
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,540
Unification.

59
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
The root word of unification is to unify.

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,370
So what does that mean?

61
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,610
At the level of unification now you are no longer the one who's

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
primarily hired to do that thing.

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,650
Instead, you manage people, processes, and projects to do that thing.

64
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,770
So now you are using your management skills.

65
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,910
This is the level of unification.

66
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,010
It is a higher level of value in the marketplace, which is why if

67
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
you're at the level of unification, oftentimes, generally you have the

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
title of manager, you're managing those three P's, people, processes,

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and projects.

70
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Sometimes you also manage policies.

71
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,490
So now you're a management of those three or four P's.

72
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Now, at the level of management, you have a little bit more impact,

73
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,860
and generally you do make a little bit more money.

74
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
You do have a a higher, a higher income as well.

75
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
But the problem with unification is that there's this churn and burn.

76
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
So here's what I mean by that.

77
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,030
Oftentimes, as an executive coach, I see managers at this level of

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
unification, and they still feel undervalued.

79
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
They still feel unappreciated.

80
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
And what the they, they believe in this level, they, there's two lies

81
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
that people believe the two biggest mistakes because of these lies

82
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,480
that we have been programmed to believe, the first lie is that, well,

83
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
maybe I need more education.

84
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,900
And so what happens is a lot of people at the level of unification,

85
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
they go back to school, they get their MBAs, their master's degree,

86
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
they go back for certifications, pmp, they put a lot of letters after

87
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,240
their name, and they get licenses, certification degrees, diplomas,

88
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
believing that, well, maybe I need to be get, be more educated in

89
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
order for people to notice me, in order for me to be more visible, in

90
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
order for me to be able to do my job well.

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,360
So their mentality is still in implementation, even though they're at

92
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
the level of unification and they feel even more burned out because an

93
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,080
MBA is a lot of energy expenditure or it's assume more debt to take on

94
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,110
diplomas degrees and certifications.

95
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
They take on more debt only to come back to still feel unappreciated

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
and undervalued.

97
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,050
So there's a churn and burn.

98
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,460
Now, that's the first lie.

99
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
The first lie is, I need more education.

100
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
The second lie is the belief that, well, maybe I need to work harder

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
to prove myself.

102
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,890
So then what I see a lot of of managers doing is they work harder,

103
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,680
they work longer hours, they take on more projects.

104
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,440
They can't say no, they say yes to things.

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
And again, they're churn and burn.

106
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
They feel burned out, and they still feel undervalued, unappreciated

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
still stuck at this level.

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
How come I'm not moving up?

109
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
How come opportunities aren't coming to me?

110
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,360
How come I can't be more competitive for these higher opportunities

111
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
solving bigger and greater problems and challenges?

112
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
Why am I still stuck here?

113
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
And that's the churn and burn because of those two lies?

114
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,830
I need more education or I need to work harder to prove myself.

115
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
And that is comes from programming, external programming that's

116
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
telling us, well, you need an education.

117
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
You need to be good at what you do.

118
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
You need to prove yourself.

119
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,760
But have you ever noticed that that the harder you work, there's one

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
guarantee is that you feel more tired, you feel more exhausted, right?

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
There's this churn and burn, there's burnout.

122
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
But what if I told you that it's not about working harder to prove

123
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
yourself?

124
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
And it's definitely not about going back to school.

125
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,770
It is about taking your career and your life and yourself, your

126
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
person, to the highest level of value.

127
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
And so let's talk about what is the next level of value.

128
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
Now, let's review what we talked about so far.

129
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,170
We talked about the first two levels of value.

130
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
First level of value is implementation, which is lowest level.

131
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
The next level from that is unification.

132
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
That's the second level of value in the marketplace and the highest

133
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
level of value, you go from implementation to unification.

134
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,740
And the highest level of value is communication.

135
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Communication.

136
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,330
So what does that mean?

137
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,450
It means being a great communicator.

138
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,170
It means communications between you and somebody else.

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
Successful communications, effective communications, confident

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,840
communications.

141
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Communications as it pertains to leadership.

142
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,930
So that's exactly why you see individuals in your industry.

143
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
It doesn't matter what industry you belong to.

144
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,650
It doesn't matter what corporation you are work with.

145
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
It could be a large corporation, it could be a startup, it could be a

146
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
non-profit.

147
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
You're gonna see this again and again and again, individuals who are

148
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
less educated, individuals who don't even have as many years of

149
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
experience as you individuals who do not have the technical knowledge

150
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,770
as you.

151
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Sometimes they need to come to you for help because they're not as

152
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,240
good as you at what they do.

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
You're good at what you do.

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
They're not necessarily good at what they do.

155
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
But the thing about them is they can talk really well.

156
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,150
They have confident communications, they can articulate their

157
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
thoughts, express themselves very clearly, and individuals find their

158
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
charisma, their leadership through their communications.

159
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
Individuals who speak well simply because they can speak well, they

160
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,760
get promoted, they get recognized, they are more visible.

161
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,510
They are the preferred choice.

162
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Opportunities flow to these individuals, and their career trajectory

163
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,270
goes a lot farther and faster.

164
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,700
And I get it, it hardly seems fair because we were taught, we were

165
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
programmed by the education system and by society that you need to go

166
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
to school and get good grades so that you can be good at what you do.

167
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
But the reason why this happens, and it does not seem fair, it doesn't

168
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
feel fair, it feels so unfair.

169
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
But the reason why that happens is because the marketplace values

170
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,820
communication.

171
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,260
Communication is the highest level of value in the marketplace, and

172
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
this is the most, one of the most important principles to understand.

173
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,690
So if you are listening to this and you're nodding your head and

174
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
you've experienced that, a coworker, a colleague, advancing faster,

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
farther, even though they are less experienced, less educated.

176
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
If you're noticing this and you understand it, and now you can see

177
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
why, you can see behind the scenes of why this is happening and you

178
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,640
understand the importance of great communications, then I invite you

179
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
to work with me.

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Every single week I train on effective communications.

181
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Communications as it pertains to leadership, how to position yourself

182
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
in the marketplace.

183
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Positioning is all about communications.

184
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,220
And more importantly, how you communicate effectively, communicate

185
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
authentically, communicate powerfully how you achieve that skill set.

186
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
How do you manage your communication skills and become a great orator.

187
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,570
If this is a skill that you are serious about developing because you

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
