# Day 1 Thinking by Jeff Bezos

## The Concept of Day One Thinking

Day One Thinking, as outlined by Bezos in his 2017 shareholder letter, is a mindset aimed at keeping Amazon innovative and customer-focused. The name "Day One" originated from the building Bezos first worked in, and he carried the name with him when he moved to a new location. The core idea is to maintain the initial enthusiasm, drive, and customer-centric approach that fuels a business's early success but often diminishes over time, leading to a more self-centered and less customer-oriented approach.



## The Importance of Day One Thinking

The absence of Day One Thinking can lead to stagnation, irrelevance, a slow and painful decline, and eventually, the death of a business. This decline may occur slowly, allowing a well-established company to profit from a Day Two mentality for years, but the end result remains the same. The challenge, therefore, is to prevent Day Two by preserving the vitality of Day One within a large organization.



## The Four Pillars of Day One Defense

Bezos suggests four key strategies for maintaining a Day One mindset:

1. **Customer Obsession**: This involves a relentless focus on pleasing the customer and recognizing that customers are always "happily dissatisfied". There are always new ways to delight customers, even if they don't realize it yet.

2. **Outcome Orientation**: As companies grow, they often become process-oriented, focusing on tasks rather than results. In a startup, every action must yield results due to limited resources. As companies grow and resources increase, the focus can shift from achieving results to simply completing tasks.

3. **Early Adoption of Trends**: This involves embracing change and being willing to try new things. You don't need to be the first to adopt a trend, but you should be open to new ideas and innovations.

4. **High-Velocity Decision-Making**: As companies grow and involve more stakeholders, decision-making can become slower and more contentious. Bezos advocates for quick decision-making, especially for decisions that can be easily reversed.



## Conclusion

In conclusion, Day One Thinking keeps a business fresh, vibrant, and customer-focused. It also creates a more enjoyable work environment because things are always happening. Falling into a Day Two mentality can be easy as we get comfortable, but it's also risky and less rewarding. So, keep challenging yourself and your team to stay in the Day One mindset.
