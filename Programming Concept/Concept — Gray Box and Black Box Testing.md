# Gray Box and Black Box Testing

In the context of penetration testing, black-box and gray-box refer to two different approaches to testing the security of a system.

In a **black-box** testing assignment, the penetration tester is placed in the role of an average hacker, with no internal knowledge of the target system. Testers are not provided with any architecture diagrams or source code that is not publicly available. A black-box penetration test determines the vulnerabilities in a system that are exploitable from outside the network¹.



On the other hand, **gray-box** testing is a step up from black-box testing. A gray-box tester has the access and knowledge levels of a user, potentially with elevated privileges on a system. Gray-box pentesters typically have some knowledge of a network’s internals, potentially including design and architecture documentation and an account internal to the network¹.



Here's a table that summarizes the differences between black-box and gray-box testing:

| Testing Type | Knowledge of Target System | Provided Information |
|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Black-Box    | No internal knowledge      | None                 |
| Gray-Box     | Some internal knowledge    | Design and architecture documentation, internal account |
