# Settings vs Configuration

_ChatGPT, ChatGPT, kami datang karena gabut, kami pulang bawa kabar_



## Question

```markdown
which one is better name, "Settings" or "Configuration" for application?
```



## Answer

```markdown
Both "Settings" and "Configuration" are commonly used to refer to the user-customizable options and preferences for an application. Ultimately, the choice between these two names depends on the specific context and usage of the application.

"Settings" is a more commonly used term and may be more familiar to users. It is often used in the context of mobile and desktop applications, as well as web applications. "Settings" typically refers to options and preferences that are specific to a particular instance of the application, such as language, theme, and notification preferences.

"Configuration" is a more technical term and may be more appropriate for applications that are used in an enterprise or business setting. It often refers to options and preferences that are set by system administrators or IT professionals, such as database connections, network settings, and security configurations.

In general, it is important to choose a name that accurately reflects the purpose and functionality of the options and preferences being presented to the user. The name should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, and should align with the overall branding and design of the application.
