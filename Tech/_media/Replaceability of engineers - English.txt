we're not special and generally
replaceable but we're skilled and
valuable that's a good way to put it
Ryan that's a good way to put it
software Engineers are replaceable like
it depends on the specificity of what
you do so like a good programmer that
has aligned themselves well I think is
mostly concerned about internal tooling
at a job if you're just building out the
UI you are more replaceable if you are
building out the UI and developing ways
for other people to become better at the
job and developing tools and things like
that you are more worthwhile to that
company you have another skill set
that's kind of showing
