software development is easy like it's
not a big deal it's not rocket science I
feel like it's a bit Soul crushing I'm
not going to lie to you there's few
things that piss me off more than when
someone's like ah it's super easy it's
just like it's simple Yes easy no you
know running a marathon is simple it
really is there's like nothing to it put
one foot in front of the other until
you're done it's like left right left
right I can say it in two words what you
got to do left right done move forward
doesn't mean it's easy it's hard it
takes countless hours of training and at
the end of the day you still might not
be successful you still May your
pants on Mile 16
