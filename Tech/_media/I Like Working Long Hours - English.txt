the ability to work long hours is
probably some sort of cross-section
between passion motivation discipline
kind of like life requirement and
genetics mild Insanity potentially you
know I like a good 60 hours a week
that's a good amount for me to be able
to learn and understand to new things
and to be able to get deeper into
situations I'm doing I don't know just
makes me it makes me happy
