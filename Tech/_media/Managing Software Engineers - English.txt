this is like my strongest stance on
software engineering which is that you
don't need a lot of management what you
actually need is to have a group of
people that just simply say no no you
can't use this framework no you can't
introduce more abstraction no stop
trying to create our own brand new
spanking protocol like that's it and I
think all software engineering would
just be a success like that's it
